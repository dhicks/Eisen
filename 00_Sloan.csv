Nitrite, nitrate, chlorite, chlorate, bromide, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids as well as the biocide concentration at sampled points were measured. Only 8/84 samples treated with monochloramine were found contaminated and after the first 8 months of treatment no Legionella was isolated. Chlorine dioxide was associated with a strong reduction in Legionella contamination compared to pre-treatment, but differences according to the device were observed. Monochloramine between 2 and 3 mg l(-1) and chlorine dioxide between 0.50 and 0.70 mg l(-1) were needed to control Legionella colonization. Comparing no- and post-flush samples, a higher frequency of no-flush positive samples was noted using chlorine dioxide, suggesting an increased risk for patients when they open the tap. No increase in chlorite levels and no water nitrification occurred by using monochloramine. Chlorite at levels exceeding the limit requested for drinking water was measured when chlorine dioxide was applied. In conclusion, we highlight that continuous injection of monochloramine should be considered as an effective alternative to chlorine dioxide in controlling legionellae contamination inside hospital water distribution systems.","2013-12","2016-04-21 18:39:46","2016-04-21 18:39:46","","738-747","","4","11","","J Water Health","Monochloramine and chlorine dioxide for controlling Legionella pneumophila contamination","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24334848","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24334848","G-B2013-12","Water Microbiology; Legionella pneumophila; Time Factors; Disinfectants; Hospitals; Water Purification; Chloramines; Chlorine Compounds; Oxides; Disinfection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monochloramine is a relatively new approach to on-site disinfection, but the microbiological impact of on-site chloramine use has not been well studied. We hypothesized that comparison of the microbial ecology associated with monochloramine treatment versus no on-site treatment would yield highly dissimilar bacterial communities. Hot water samples were collected monthly from 7 locations for three months from two buildings in a Pennsylvania hospital complex supplied with common municipal water: (1) a hospital administrative building (no on-site treatment) and (2) an adjacent acute-care hospital treated on-site with monochloramine to control Legionella spp. Water samples were subjected to DNA extraction, rRNA PCR, and 454 pyrosequencing. Stark differences in the microbiome of the chloraminated water and the control were observed. Bacteria in the treated samples were primarily Sphingomonadales and Limnohabitans, whereas Flexibacter and Planctomycetaceae predominated in untreated control samples. Serendipitously, one sampling month coincided with dysfunction of the on-site disinfection system that resulted in a Legionella bloom detected by sequencing and culture. This study also demonstrates the potential utility of high-throughput DNA sequencing to monitor microbial ecology in water systems.","2015-05","2016-04-21 18:39:46","2016-04-21 18:39:46","","198-205","","3","38","","Syst.

SETTING: A 495-bed tertiary care hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The hospital has 12 floors covering approximately 78,000 m(2). METHODS: The hospital hot water system was monitored for a total of 29 months, including a 5-month baseline sampling period prior to installation of the monochloramine system and 24 months of surveillance after system installation (postdisinfection period). Water samples were collected for microbiological analysis (Legionella species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter species, nitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic plate count [HPC] bacteria, and nontuberculous mycobacteria). Chemical parameters monitored during the investigation included monochloramine, chlorine (free and total), nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia, copper, silver, lead, and pH. RESULTS: A significant reduction in Legionella distal site positivity was observed between the pre- and postdisinfection periods, with positivity decreasing from an average of 53% (baseline) to an average of 9% after monochloramine application (P<0.5]). Although geometric mean HPC concentrations decreased by approximately 2 log colony-forming units per milliliter during monochloramine treatment, we did not observe significant changes in other microbial populations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation in the United States of a commercially available monochloramine system installed on a hospital hot water system for Legionella disinfection, and it demonstrated a significant reduction in Legionella colonization. Significant increases in microbial populations or other negative effects previously associated with monochloramine use in large municipal cold water systems were not observed.","2014-11","2016-04-21 18:39:46","2016-04-21 18:39:46","","1356-1363","","11","35","","Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25333430","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333430","G-B2013-12","Water Microbiology; Acinetobacter; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Humans; Disinfectants; Tertiary Care Centers; Water Purification; Water; Chloramines; Legionnaires' Disease; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Colony Count, Microbial; Hot Temperature; Disinfection; Legionella","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On-site supplemental disinfection systems have been proposed as a control method for opportunistic pathogens in premise plumbing. The majority of on-site disinfection systems to date have been installed in hospitals due to the high concentration of opportunistic pathogen susceptible occupants. The installation of on-site supplemental disinfection systems in hospitals allows for evaluation of the impact of on-site disinfection systems on drinking water system microbial ecology prior to widespread application. This study evaluated the impact of supplemental monochloramine on the microbial ecology of a hospital’s hot water system. Samples were taken three months and immediately prior to monochloramine treatment and monthly for the first six months of treatment, and all samples were subjected to high throughput Illumina 16S rRNA region sequencing. The microbial community composition of monochloramine treated samples was dramatically different than the baseline months. There was an immediate shift towards decreased relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria, and increased relative abundance of Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria. Following treatment, microbial populations grouped by sampling location rather than sampling time. Over the course of treatment the relative abundance of certain genera containing opportunistic pathogens and genera containing denitrifying bacteria increased. The results demonstrate the driving influence of supplemental disinfection on premise plumbing microbial ecology and suggest the value of further investigation into the overall effects of premise plumbing disinfection strategies on microbial ecology and not solely specific target microorganisms.","2014-07-17","2016-04-21 18:57:01","2017-08-14 22:29:29","2016-04-21 18:57:01","","","7","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25033448 PMCID: PMC4102543","","false; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\PBEKAFU8\Baron et al. - 2014 - Shift in the Microbial Ecology of a Hospital Hot W.pdf; ; ","; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102543/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033448","G-B2013-12","Water Microbiology; Biofilms; Base Sequence; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Cyanobacteria; Proteobacteria; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Actinobacteria; Disinfectants; Sanitary Engineering; Hospital Distribution Systems; DNA, Bacterial; Tertiary Care Centers; Water Purification; Water Quality; Chloramines; Drinking Water; Disinfection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results demonstrate that the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, Peniophora, Cladosporium and Rhodosporidium comprised the core fungal biome of the hospital hot water system. Penicillium dominated the fungal community with an average relative abundance of 88.89% (±6.37%). ITS1 sequences of fungal genera containing potential pathogens such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium were also detected in this study. No significant change in fungal community structure was observed before and after the initiation of on-site monochloramine water treatment.

As an imaging proof of principle, we first demonstrated visualization of Escherichia coli labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 28 different binary combinations of eight fluorophores. As a biological proof of principle, we then applied this Combinatorial Labeling and Spectral Imaging FISH (CLASI-FISH) strategy using genus- and family-specific probes to visualize simultaneously and differentiate 15 different phylotypes in an artificial mixture of laboratory-grown microbes. We then illustrated the utility of our method for the structural analysis of a natural microbial community, namely, human dental plaque, a microbial biofilm. We demonstrate that 15 taxa in the plaque community can be imaged simultaneously and analyzed and that this community was dominated by early colonizers, including species of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Veillonella. Proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of inter- and intrataxon cell-to-cell associations which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings.

We applied culture-independent methods based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to investigate the diversity and temporal dynamics of fungi in restrooms. Swab samples were collected weekly from three different surfaces in two public restrooms (male and female) in San Diego, CA, U.S.A. over an 8-week period. DNA amplification and culturing methods both found that the floor samples had significantly higher fungal loads than other surfaces. NGS sequencing of floor fungal assemblages identified a total of 2550 unique phylotypes (~800 per sample), less than half of which were identifiable. Of the known fungi, the majority came from environmental sources and we found little evidence of known human skin fungi. Fungal assemblages reformed rapidly in a highly consistent manner and the variance in the species diversity among samples was low.

In this study, we combined culture-based cell counting and multiplexed pyrosequencing of environmental ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences to investigate office space bacterial diversity in three metropolitan areas. Five surfaces common to all offices were sampled using sterile double-tipped swabs, one tip for culturing and one for DNA extraction, in 30 different offices per city (90 offices, 450 total samples). 16S rRNA gene sequences were PCR amplified using bar-coded “universal” bacterial primers from 54 of the surfaces (18 per city) and pooled for pyrosequencing. A three-factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) found significant differences in viable bacterial abundance between offices inhabited by men or women, among the various surface types, and among cities. Multiplex pyrosequencing identified more than 500 bacterial genera from 20 different bacterial divisions. The most abundant of these genera tended to be common inhabitants of human skin, nasal, oral or intestinal cavities. Other commonly occurring genera appeared to have environmental origins (e.g., soils). There were no significant differences in the bacterial diversity between offices inhabited by men or women or among surfaces, but the bacterial community diversity of the Tucson samples was clearly distinguishable from that of New York and San Francisco, which were indistinguishable. Overall, our comprehensive molecular analysis of office building microbial diversity shows the potential of these methods for studying patterns and origins of indoor bacterial contamination. “[H]umans move through a sea of microbial life that is seldom perceived except in the context of potential disease and decay.” – Feazel et al.

We demonstrate that the gut bacterial community plays a pivotal role in production of aggregation pheromones in the German cockroach. The feces of normal and gut bacteria-inoculated cockroaches emits highly attractive volatile carboxylic acids (VCAs) that elicit aggregation whereas bacteria-free feces contains few VCAs and is relatively unattractive. VCAs may reflect the gut microbiota and, in turn, the cockroach's local environment, explaining why divergent chemical structures have been proposed as aggregation pheromones. This new insight emphasizes the importance of gut microbes in insect–insect communication and highlights the plasticity of the chemistry and function of fecal aggregation pheromones., Aggregation of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is regulated by fecal aggregation agents (pheromones), including volatile carboxylic acids (VCAs). We demonstrate that the gut microbial community contributes to production of these semiochemicals. Chemical analysis of the fecal extract of B. germanica revealed 40 VCAs. Feces from axenic cockroaches (no microorganisms in the alimentary tract) lacked 12 major fecal VCAs, and 24 of the remaining compounds were represented at extremely low amounts. Olfactory and aggregation bioassays demonstrated that nymphs strongly preferred the extract of control feces over the fecal extract of axenic cockroaches. Additionally, nymphs preferred a synthetic blend of 6 fecal VCAs over a solvent control or a previously identified VCA blend. To test whether gut bacteria contribute to the production of fecal aggregation agents, fecal aerobic bacteria were cultured, isolated, and identified. Inoculation of axenic cockroaches with individual bacterial taxa significantly rescued the aggregation response to the fecal extract, and inoculation with a mix of six bacterial isolates was more effective than with single isolates. The results indicate that the commensal gut microbiota contributes to production of VCAs that act as fecal aggregation agents and that cockroaches discriminate among the complex odors that emanate from a diverse microbial community. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gut bacteria in mediating insect–insect communication. Moreover, because the gut microbial community reflects the local environment, local plasticity in fecal aggregation pheromones enables colony-specific odors and fidelity to persistent aggregation sites.","2015-12-22","2016-05-10 17:25:12","2016-05-10 17:25:12","2016-05-10 17:25:12","15678-15683","","51","112","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26644557 PMCID: PMC4697420","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\I6I3UZKS\Wada-Katsumata et al. - 2015 - Gut bacteria mediate aggregation in the German coc.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4697420/","G-2013-5-35 MBE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important property of some bait formulations is secondary kill, whereby active ingredient is translocated in insect-produced residues throughout the cockroach population, especially affecting relatively sedentary early instar nymphs. RESULTS: Blattella germanica was collected from a location where baits containing hydramethylnon, fipronil, or indoxacarb became ineffective, and these AIs were topically applied to adult males. Results revealed the first evidence for hydramethylnon resistance, moderate resistance to fipronil and extremely high resistance to indoxacarb. Insecticide residues excreted by field-collected males that ingested commercial baits effectively killed nymphs of an insecticide-susceptible laboratory strain of B. germanica but failed to kill most nymphs of the field-collected strain. CONCLUSIONS: We report three novel findings: 1) The first evidence for hydramethylnon resistance in any insect; 2) extremely high levels of indoxacarb resistance in a field population; and 3) reduced secondary mortality in an insecticide-resistant field-collected strain of B. germanica. We suggest that while secondary mortality is considered to be advantageous in cockroach interventions, the ingestion of sublethal doses of AI by nymphs may select for high insecticide resistance by increasing the frequency of AI resistance alleles within the population.","2015-12-22","2016-05-10 17:26:20","2016-05-10 17:26:20","","","","","","","Pest Manag.

Quantitative PCR and multiplexed DNA sequencing were employed to count and identify allergenic fungal aerosol particles indoors and outdoors in seven school classrooms in four different countries. Quantitative diversity analysis was combined with building characterization and mass balance modeling to apportion source contributions of indoor allergenic airborne fungal particles. Mass balance calculations indicate that 70% of indoor fungal aerosol particles and 80% of airborne allergenic fungal taxa were associated with indoor emissions; on average, 81% of allergenic fungi from indoor sources originated from occupant-generated emissions. Principal coordinate analysis revealed geographical variations in fungal communities among sites in China, Europe, and North America (p < 0.05, analysis of similarity), demonstrating that geography may also affect personal exposures to allergenic fungi. Indoor emissions including those released with occupancy contribute more substantially to allergenic fungal exposures in classrooms sampled than do outdoor contributions from ventilation. The results suggest that design and maintenance of buildings to control indoor emissions may enable reduced indoor inhalation exposures to fungal allergens.","2015-04-21","2016-05-10 17:46:55","2016-05-10 17:46:55","","5098-5106","","8","49","","Environ.

Despite the ubiquity of microbes in BEs and their potential impacts on health and building materials, basic questions about the microbiology of these environments remain unanswered. We present a study on the impacts of geography, material type, human interaction, location in a room, seasonal variation, and indoor and microenvironmental parameters on bacterial communities in offices. Our data elucidate several important features of microbial communities in BEs. First, under normal office environmental conditions, bacterial communities do not differ on the basis of surface material (e.g., ceiling tile or carpet) but do differ on the basis of the location in a room (e.g., ceiling or floor), two features that are often conflated but that we are able to separate here. We suspect that previous work showing differences in bacterial composition with surface material was likely detecting differences based on different usage patterns. Next, we find that offices have city-specific bacterial communities, such that we can accurately predict which city an office microbiome sample is derived from, but office-specific bacterial communities are less apparent. This differs from previous work, which has suggested office-specific compositions of bacterial communities. We again suspect that the difference from prior work arises from different usage patterns. As has been previously shown, we observe that human skin contributes heavily to the composition of BE surfaces. IMPORTANCE Our study highlights several points that should impact the design of future studies of the microbiology of BEs. First, projects tracking changes in BE bacterial communities should focus sampling efforts on surveying different locations in offices and in different cities but not necessarily different materials or different offices in the same city. Next, disturbance due to repeated sampling, though detectable, is small compared to that due to other variables, opening up a range of longitudinal study designs in the BE. Next, studies requiring more samples than can be sequenced on a single sequencing run (which is increasingly common) must control for run effects by including some of the same samples in all of the sequencing runs as technical replicates. Finally, detailed tracking of indoor and material environment covariates is likely not essential for BE microbiome studies, as the normal range of indoor environmental conditions is likely not large enough to impact bacterial communities.","2016-04-26","2016-05-10 17:51:52","2017-08-14 22:28:48","2016-05-10 17:51:52","e00022-16","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2016 Chase et al..

The abundance of microbial communities, determined by quantifying bacterial 16S RNA genes and the fungal ITS region, in air collected directly above vegetation was 2 to 10-fold higher than that collected simultaneously in an adjacent non-vegetated area 50 m upwind. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling exploiting the Bray-Curtis index revealed that composition of airborne bacteria in upwind air samples grouped separately from downwind air samples, while communities on plants and downwind air could not be distinguished. In contrast, fungal taxa in air samples were more similar to each other than to the fungal epiphytes. A source tracking algorithm revealed that up to 50% of airborne bacteria in downwind air samples were presumably of local plant origin. The difference of the proportional abundance of a given OTU between downwind and upwind air when regressed against the proportional representation of this OTU on the plant yielded a positive slope for both bacteria and fungi, indicating that those taxa that were most abundant on plants proportionally contributed more to downwind air. Epiphytic fungi were less of a determinant of the microbiological distinctiveness of downwind air compared to upwind air than epiphytic bacteria. Emigration of epiphytic bacteria and, to a lesser extent fungi, from plants can thus influence the microbial composition of nearby air, a finding that has important implications for surrounding ecosystems, including the built environment into which outdoor air can penetrate. IMPORTANCE: The manuscript addresses the poorly understood role of bacterial and fungal epiphytes - the inhabitants of the aboveground plant parts - to the composition of airborne microbes in outdoor air. It is widely held that epiphytes contribute to atmospheric microbial assemblages, but much of what we know is limited to qualitative assessments. Elucidating the sources of microbes of outdoor air can inform basic biological processes seen in airborne communities (e.g., dispersal, biogeographical patterns). Furthermore, given the considerable contribution of outdoor air to microbial communities found within indoor environments, the understanding of plants as sources of airborne microbes in outdoor air could contribute to our understanding of indoor air quality. With an experimental design developed to minimize the likelihood of other than local plant sources to the composition of airborne microbes, we provide direct evidence that plants are quantitatively important local sources of airborne microorganisms, with implications for the surrounding ecosystems.","2016-04-22","2016-05-10 18:33:46","2016-05-10 18:33:46","","","","","","","Appl.

Overall, this study revealed a smaller signature of human body-associated taxa than had been expected based on recent studies of indoor microbiomes, suggesting that occupants may not exert a strong influence on bioaerosol microbial composition in a space that, like many offices, is well ventilated with air that is moderately filtered and moderately occupied.","2015-05-29","2016-05-10 18:36:33","2016-05-10 18:36:33","2016-05-10 18:36:33","","","5","10","","PLoS One","Chamber Bioaerosol Study","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26024222 PMCID: PMC4449033","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\N566F84G\Adams et al. - 2015 - Chamber Bioaerosol Study Outdoor Air and Human Oc.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449033/","G-2014-3-02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, environmental exposure to microorganisms has important implications for human health, and a better understanding of the ecological drivers and processes that impact indoor microbial assemblages will be key for expanding our knowledge of the built environment. In the present investigation, we combined recent studies examining the microbiota of the built environment in order to identify unifying community patterns and the relative importance of indoor environmental factors. Ultimately, the present meta-analysis focused on studies of bacteria and archaea due to the limited number of high-throughput fungal studies from the indoor environment. We combined 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene datasets from 16 surveys of indoor environments conducted worldwide, additionally including 7 other studies representing putative environmental sources of microbial taxa (outdoor air, soil, and the human body). Results Combined analysis of subsets of studies that shared specific experimental protocols or indoor habitats revealed community patterns indicative of consistent source environments and environmental filtering. Additionally, we were able to identify several consistent sources for indoor microorganisms, particularly outdoor air and skin, mirroring what has been shown in individual studies. Technical variation across studies had a strong effect on comparisons of microbial community assemblages, with differences in experimental protocols limiting our ability to extensively explore the importance of, for example, sampling locality, building function and use, or environmental substrate in structuring indoor microbial communities. Conclusions We present a snapshot of an important scientific field in its early stages, where studies have tended to focus on heavy sampling in a few geographic areas. From the practical perspective, this endeavor reinforces the importance of negative “kit” controls in microbiome studies. From the perspective of understanding mechanistic processes in the built environment, this meta-analysis confirms that broad factors, such as geography and building type, structure indoor microbes. However, this exercise suggests that individual studies with common sampling techniques may be more appropriate to explore the relative importance of subtle indoor environmental factors on the indoor microbiome.

The chamber investigation reported here employs a fluorescence-based technique to evaluate bioaerosols with high temporal and particle size resolution. In a 75-m(3) chamber, occupant emission rates of coarse (2.5-10 μm) fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAPs) under seated, simulated office-work conditions averaged 0.9 ± 0.3 million particles per person-h. Walking was associated with a 5-6× increase in the emission rate. During both walking and sitting, 60-70% or more of emissions originated from the floor. The increase in emissions during walking (vs. while sitting) was mainly attributable to release of particles from the floor; the associated increased vigor of upper body movements also contributed. Clothing, or its frictional interaction with human skin, was demonstrated to be a source of coarse particles, and especially of the highly fluorescent fraction. Emission rates of FBAPs previously reported for lecture classes were well bounded by the experimental results obtained in this chamber study. In both settings, the size distribution of occupant FBAP emissions had a dominant mode in the 3-5 μm diameter range.","2016-04","2016-05-10 18:48:30","2017-08-14 22:28:33","","193-206","","2","26","","Indoor Air","Chamber bioaerosol study","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25704637","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25704637","G-2014-3-02","Resuspension; Source strength; UV-APS; Occupancy; Human activity; Flooring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present a study that examined the bacterial component of passively settled microbes from both indoor and outdoor air over a discrete time period and for which the fungal component has already been reported. Dust was allowed to passively settle in five common locations around a home − living room, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and balcony − at different dwellings within a university-housing complex for a one-month period at two time points, once in summer and again in winter. We amplified the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in these samples and analyzed them with high-throughput sequencing. Like fungal OTU-richness, bacterial OTU-richness was higher outdoors then indoors and was invariant across different indoor room types. While fungal composition was structured largely by season and residential unit, bacterial composition varied by residential unit and room type. Bacteria from putative outdoor sources, such as Sphingomonas and Deinococcus, comprised a large percentage of the balcony samples, while human-associated taxa comprised a large percentage of the indoor samples. Abundant outdoor bacterial taxa were also observed indoors, but the reverse was not true; this is unlike fungi, in which the taxa abundant indoors were also well-represented outdoors. Moreover, there was a partial association of bacterial composition and geographic distance, such that samples separated by even a few hundred meters tended have greater compositional differences than samples closer together in space, a pattern also observed for fungi. These data show that while the outdoor source for indoor bacteria and fungi varies in both space and time, humans provide a strong and homogenizing effect on indoor bacterial bioaerosols, a pattern not observed in fungi.","2014-03-06","2016-05-10 18:52:00","2016-05-10 18:52:00","2016-05-10 18:52:00","","","3","9","","PLoS One","Airborne Bacterial Communities in Residences","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24603548 PMCID: PMC3946336","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\93REZZ3F\Adams et al. - 2014 - Airborne Bacterial Communities in Residences Simi.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946336/","G-2010-10-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test the fungal aspect of this hypothesis, we sampled fungi from three surface types likely to support growth and therefore possible contributors of fungi to indoor air: drains in kitchens and bathrooms, sills beneath condensation-prone windows, and skin of human inhabitants. Sampling was done in replicated units of a university-housing complex without reported mold problems, and sequences were analyzed using both QIIME and the new UPARSE approach to OTU-binning, to the same result. Surfaces demonstrated a mycological profile similar to that of outdoor air from the same locality, and assemblages clustered by surface type. “Weedy” genera typical of indoor air, such as Cladosporium and Cryptococcus, were abundant on sills, as were a diverse set of fungi of likely outdoor origin. Drains supported more depauperate assemblages than the other surfaces and contained thermotolerant genera such as Exophiala, Candida, and Fusarium. Most surprising was the composition detected on residents’ foreheads. In addition to harboring Malassezia, a known human commensal, skin also possessed a surprising richness of non-resident fungi, including plant pathogens such as ergot (Claviceps purperea). Overall, fungal richness across indoor surfaces was high, but based on known autecologies, most of these fungi were unlikely to be growing on surfaces. We conclude that while some endogenous fungal growth on typical household surfaces does occur, particularly on drains and skin, all residential surfaces appear – to varying degrees – to be passive collectors of airborne fungi of putative outdoor origin, a view of the origins of the indoor microbiome quite different from bacteria.","2013-11-01","2016-05-10 18:53:00","2016-05-10 18:53:00","2016-05-10 18:53:00","","","11","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24223861 PMCID: PMC3815347","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\SHHTTUQZ\Adams et al. - 2013 - The Diversity and Distribution of Fungi on Residen.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815347/","G-2010-10-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A standard practice in current high-throughput sequence (HTS) approaches in microbial ecology is to sequence the composition of many environmental samples at once by pooling amplicon libraries at a common concentration before processing on one run of a sequencing platform. Biomass of the target taxa, however, is not typically determined prior to HTS, and here, we show that when abundances of the samples differ to a large degree, this standard practice can lead to a perceived bias in community richness and composition. Fungal signal in settled dust of five university teaching laboratory classrooms, one of which was used for a mycology course, was surveyed. The fungal richness and composition in the dust of the nonmycology classrooms were remarkably similar to each other, while the mycology classroom was dominated by abundantly sporulating specimen fungi, particularly puffballs, and appeared to have a lower overall richness based on rarefaction curves and richness estimators. The fungal biomass was three to five times higher in the mycology classroom than the other classrooms, indicating that fungi added to the mycology classroom swamped the background fungi present in indoor air. Thus, the high abundance of a few taxa can skew the perception of richness and composition when samples are sequenced to an even depth. Next, we used in silico manipulations of the observed data to confirm that a unique signature can be identified with HTS approaches when the source is abundant, whether or not the taxon identity is distinct. Lastly, aerobiology of indoor fungi is discussed.","2013","2016-05-10 18:53:48","2016-05-10 18:53:48","2016-05-10 18:53:48","735-741","","4","66","","Microb Ecol","A Unique Signal Distorts the Perception of Species Richness and Composition in High-Throughput Sequencing Surveys of Microbial Communities","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23880792 PMCID: PMC3824195","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\JVMQV4Z5\Adams et al. - 2013 - A Unique Signal Distorts the Perception of Species.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3824195/","G-2010-10-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We surveyed airborne fungal assemblages within 1-month time periods at two seasons, with high replication, indoors and outdoors, within and across standardized residences at a university housing facility. Fungal assemblages indoors were diverse and strongly determined by dispersal from outdoors, and no fungal taxa were found as indicators of indoor air. There was a seasonal effect on the fungi found in both indoor and outdoor air, and quantitatively more fungal biomass was detected outdoors than indoors. A strong signal of isolation by distance existed in both outdoor and indoor airborne fungal assemblages, despite the small geographic scale in which this study was undertaken (<500 m). Moreover, room and occupant behavior had no detectable effect on the fungi found in indoor air. These results show that at the local level, outdoor air fungi dominate the patterning of indoor air.

We hypothesize the built environment (BE), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature VLBW infants. Here, we present the first matched fecal-BE time series analysis of two preterm VLBW neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over the first month of life. Results Fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 device. For each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each NICU room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). Swabs were processed using a recently developed ‘expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment’ (EMIRGE) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16S rRNA amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an Illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. Over 24,000 full-length 16S rRNA sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. Dominant gut taxa, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. Reconstructed genomes from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the NICU environment. Conclusions We have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. The approach enabled identification of discrete ICU reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.","2014-01-28","2016-05-10 19:06:54","2017-05-23 14:20:45","2016-05-10 19:06:54","1","","","2","","Microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24468033 PMCID: PMC4392516","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\UWFA3MM3\Brooks et al. - 2014 - Microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resem.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4392516/","G-2011-6-06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, spread of potential pathogens among hospitalized infants is of great concern. Here, we reconstructed hundreds of high-quality genomes of microorganisms that colonized co-hospitalized premature infants, assessed their metabolic potential, and tracked them over time to evaluate bacterial strain dispersal among infants. We compared microbial communities in infants who did and did not develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Surprisingly, while potentially pathogenic bacteria of the same species colonized many infants, our genome-resolved analysis revealed that strains colonizing each baby were typically distinct. In particular, no strain was common to all infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis. The paucity of shared gut colonizers suggests the existence of significant barriers to the spread of bacteria among infants. Importantly, we demonstrate that strain-resolved comprehensive community analysis can be accomplished on potentially medically relevant time scales., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05477.001, The spread of potentially harmful bacteria is a major source of disease in patients staying in hospitals. Premature babies—born before 37 weeks of pregnancy—can be particularly vulnerable to these infections because their organs may not yet be fully developed. Also, young babies do not have the fully established populations of beneficial microbes that help to protect us from dangerous bacteria., Necrotizing enterocolitis—a life-threatening disease that can cause portions of the bowel to die—is mostly seen in extremely premature babies. Although it is not known what causes this serious condition, research has suggested that a contagious microbe may be responsible., The development of methods that can sequence DNA from whole communities of microbes, known as metagenomics, allows researchers to identify the presence of individual strains of bacteria within these communities. This makes it possible to compare and contrast the strains of bacteria present in both diseased and healthy individuals, to help identify the bacteria responsible for a disease., Here, Raveh-Sadka et al. used a metagenomics approach to study the communities of microbes present in premature babies in a hospital unit during an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis. The study found that very few bacterial strains were present in more than one baby, suggesting that bacterial strains are not readily transferred between the babies while they are in the hospital. Furthermore, Raveh-Sadka et al. reveal that no single bacterial strain was shared among all the babies who developed necrotizing enterocolitis., These findings indicate that necrotizing enterocolitis is not caused by a single strain of bacterium. Instead, if bacteria do contribute to the disease, it maybe that it is caused by a variety of potentially harmful bacteria colonizing the gut at the cost of beneficial bacteria. In future, better understanding of the barriers that limit the transfer of bacteria between premature babies could help inform efforts to reduce the spread of infections between patients in hospitals., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05477.002","","2016-05-10 19:08:47","2018-03-15 16:50:51","2016-05-10 19:08:47","","","","4","","eLife","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25735037 PMCID: PMC4384745","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\N2FUISZG\Raveh-Sadka et al. - Gut bacteria are rarely shared by co-hospitalized .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4384745/","G-2012-10-05; G-2012-10-05 ?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents evidence for elevated concentrations of indoor airborne bacteria due to human occupancy, and investigates the sources of these bacteria. Samples were collected in a university classroom while occupied and when vacant. The total particle mass concentration, bacterial genome concentration, and bacterial phylogenetic populations were characterized in indoor, outdoor, and ventilation duct supply air, as well as in the dust of ventilation system filters and in floor dust. Occupancy increased the total aerosol mass and bacterial genome concentration in indoor air PM10 and PM2.5 size fractions, with an increase of nearly two orders of magnitude in airborne bacterial genome concentration in PM10. On a per mass basis, floor dust was enriched in bacterial genomes compared to airborne particles. Quantitative comparisons between bacterial populations in indoor air and potential sources suggest that resuspended floor dust is an important contributor to bacterial aerosol populations during occupancy. Experiments that controlled for resuspension from the floor implies that direct human shedding may also significantly impact the concentration of indoor airborne particles. The high content of bacteria specific to the skin, nostrils, and hair of humans found in indoor air and in floor dust indicates that floors are an important reservoir of human-associated bacteria, and that the direct particle shedding of desquamated skin cells and their subsequent resuspension strongly influenced the airborne bacteria population structure in this human-occupied environment.

Recent studies that used culture-independent sampling methods demonstrated a high diversity of indoor fungi distinct from that of outdoor environments. Others have shown temporal fluctuations of fungal assemblages in human environments and modest correlations with human activity, but global-scale patterns have not been examined, despite the manifest significance of biogeography in other microbial systems. Here we present a global survey of fungi from indoor environments (n = 72), using both taxonomic and phylogeny-informative molecular markers to determine whether global or local indoor factors determine indoor fungal composition. Contrary to common ecological patterns, we show that fungal diversity is significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics, with distance from the equator being the best predictor of phylogenetic community similarity. Fungal composition is significantly auto-correlated at the national and hemispheric spatial scales. Remarkably, building function has no significant effect on indoor fungal composition, despite stark contrasts between architecture and materials of some buildings in close proximity. Distribution of individual taxa is significantly range- and latitude-limited compared with a null model of randomized distribution. Our results suggest that factors driving fungal composition are primarily global rather than mediated by building design or function.","2010-08-03","2016-05-31 19:17:23","2017-08-14 22:29:00","2016-05-31 19:17:23","13748-13753","","31","107","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20616017 PMCID: PMC2922287","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\PI7EX95C\Amend et al. - 2010 - Indoor fungal composition is geographically patter.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922287/","G-2008-6-30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to determine whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the sampler type, we compared different passive, settled dust sampling approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota. Results Settled dust sampling approaches—utilizing plastic petri dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs)—were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a sampling environment regardless of the sampler type. The sampling environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community composition within a study, while sampler type was found to have much less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with EDCs and TefTex. The highest correlations between duplicate samples were observed for EDC and petri dish approaches, indicating greater experimental repeatability for these sampler types. For the EDC samples, it became apparent that, due to the fibrous nature of the material, a rigorous extraction protocol is crucial to obtain optimal yields and stable, repeatable results. Conclusions Correlations between sampler types were strong both in compositional and quantitative terms, and thus, the particular choice of passive settled dust sampler is not likely to strongly alter the overall conclusion of a study that aims to characterize dust across different environments. Microbial cell abundances determined from settled dust varied with the use of different sampling approaches, and thus, consistency in the method is necessary to allow for absolute comparisons within and among studies. Considering practical aspects, petri dishes were found to be an inexpensive, simple, and feasible approach that showed the highest quantitative determinations under typical building conditions, though the choice of sampler will ultimately depend on study logistics and characteristics such as low- or high-exposure settings.

In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R(2) of 0.96-0.54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but between-species comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data.","2010-12","2016-05-31 19:34:53","2017-08-14 22:29:19","","5555-5565","","24","19","","Mol.

The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.","2012-04-17","2016-05-31 19:39:37","2016-05-31 19:39:37","2016-05-31 19:39:37","6241-6246","","16","109","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22454494 PMCID: PMC3341068","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\J3UNK72M\Schoch et al. - 2012 - Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341068/","G-2011-6-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Showers are an important interface for human interaction with microbes through inhalation of aerosols, and showerhead waters have been implicated in disease. Although opportunistic pathogens commonly are cultured from shower facilities, there is little knowledge of either their prevalence or the nature of other microorganisms that may be delivered during shower usage. To determine the composition of showerhead biofilms and waters, we analyzed rRNA gene sequences from 45 showerhead sites around the United States. We find that variable and complex, but specific, microbial assemblages occur inside showerheads. Particularly striking was the finding that sequences representative of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and other opportunistic human pathogens are enriched to high levels in many showerhead biofilms, >100-fold above background water contents.

Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and human-occupied indoor environments (two clinics and a homeless shelter) were found to be a source of airborne tet(X) and tet(W) genes. The CAFOs had 10- to 100-times higher concentrations of airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes than other environments sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized bacteria correlated with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes. The two CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly different between the two operations. Additionally, tet(W) genes were recovered in outdoor air within 2 km of livestock operations, which suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may be transported via aerosols on local scales. The integrase gene (intI1) from Class 1 integrons, which has been associated with multidrug resistance, was detected in CAFOs but not in human-occupied indoor environments, suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug resistance. In conclusion, our results show that CAFOs and clinics are sources of aerosolized antibiotic resistance genes that can potentially be transported via air movement.","2013-05-07","2016-06-20 19:16:52","2016-06-20 19:16:52","","4046-4052","","9","47","","Environ.

We collected bioaerosols by fluid impingement on several New York City subway platforms and associated sites in three sampling sessions over a 1.5-year period. The types and quantities of aerosolized microorganisms were determined by culture-independent phylogenetic analysis of small-subunit rRNA gene sequences by using both Sanger (universal) and pyrosequencing (bacterial) technologies. Overall, the subway bacterial composition was relatively simple; only 26 taxonomic families made up ∼75% of the sequences determined. The microbiology was more or less similar throughout the system and with time and was most similar to outdoor air, consistent with highly efficient air mixing in the system. Identifiable bacterial sequences indicated that the subway aerosol assemblage was composed of a mixture of genera and species characteristic of soil, environmental water, and human skin commensal bacteria. Eukaryotic diversity was mainly fungal, dominated by organisms of types associated with wood rot. Human skin bacterial species (at 99% rRNA sequence identity) included the Staphylococcus spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis (the most abundant and prevalent commensal of the human integument), S. hominis, S. cohnii, S. caprae, and S. haemolyticus, all well-documented human commensal bacteria.

The genus Mycobacterium was the most abundant taxon in the dataset, detected in 56 of 63 samples (16 of 17 cities). Among the more rare phylotypes, considerable variation was observed between systems, and was sometimes associated with the type of source water, the type of disinfectant, or the concentration of the environmental pollutant nitrate. Abundant taxa (excepting Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts) were generally similar from system to system, however, regardless of source water type or local land use.

Currently there is no information on home humidifier microbiology aside from anecdotal evidence of infection with opportunistic pathogens and irritation from endotoxin exposure. To obtain a broader perspective on humidifier microbiology, DNAs were isolated from tap source waters, tank waters, and biofilm samples associated with 26 humidifiers of ultrasonic and boiling modes of operation in the Front Range of Colorado. Humidifiers sampled included units operated by individuals in their homes, display models continuously operated by a retail store, and new humidifiers operated in a controlled laboratory study. The V1V2 region of the rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced to determine the taxonomic composition of humidifier samples. Communities encountered were generally low in richness and diversity and were dominated by Sphingomonadales, Rhizobiales, and Burkholderiales of the Proteobacteria, and MLE1-12, a presumably non-photosynthetic representative of the cyanobacterial phylum.

Contemporary urban humans spend most of their time indoors, and little is known about the microbes associated with different designs of the built environment and their interaction with the human immune system. This study addresses the associations between architectural design and the microbial biogeography of households across a gradient of urbanization in South America. Urbanization was associated with households’ increased isolation from outdoor environments, with additional indoor space isolation by walls.

Measurements included environmental conditions (indoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio, and illuminance) in the patient rooms and nurse stations; differential pressure between the patient rooms and hallways; surrogate measures for human occupancy and activity in the patient rooms using both indoor air CO2 concentrations and infrared doorway beam-break counters; and outdoor air fractions in the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems serving the sampled spaces. Measurements were made at 5-minute intervals over consecutive days for nearly one year, providing a total of ∼8×106 data points.

Differential pressure measurements confirmed that all patient rooms were operated at neutral pressure. The patient rooms averaged about 100 combined entrances and exits per day, which suggests they were relatively lightly occupied compared to higher traffic environments (e.g., retail buildings) and more similar to lower traffic office environments. There were also clear differences in several environmental parameters before and after the hospital was occupied with patients and staff.

Sands of temperate climate zones represent a temporally and spatially highly dynamic marine environment characterized by strong physical mixing and seasonal variation. Yet little is known about the temporal fluctuations of resident and rare members of bacterial communities in this environment. By combining community fingerprinting via pyrosequencing of ribosomal genes with the characterization of multiple environmental parameters, we disentangled the effects of seasonality, environmental heterogeneity, sediment depth and biogeochemical gradients on the fluctuations of bacterial communities of marine sands. Surprisingly, only 3–5% of all bacterial types of a given depth zone were present at all times, but 50–80% of them belonged to the most abundant types in the data set. About 60–70% of the bacterial types consisted of tag sequences occurring only once over a period of 1 year. Most members of the rare biosphere did not become abundant at any time or at any sediment depth, but varied significantly with environmental parameters associated with nutritional stress. Despite the large proportion and turnover of rare organisms, the overall community patterns were driven by deterministic relationships associated with seasonal fluctuations in key biogeochemical parameters related to primary productivity. The maintenance of major biogeochemical functions throughout the observation period suggests that the small proportion of resident bacterial types in sands perform the key biogeochemical processes, with minimal effects from the rare fraction of the communities.","2012-03","2016-07-20 17:23:20","2016-07-20 17:23:20","2016-07-20 17:23:20","542-553","","3","6","","ISME J","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 21975598 PMCID: PMC3280144","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\JC5M5DVG\Gobet et al. - 2012 - Diversity and dynamics of rare and of resident bac.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280144/","G-2007-6-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropogenic stressors often impact these ecosystems, but little is known about whether these disturbances can be identified through microbial community change. The blowout of the Macondo Prospect reservoir on April 20, 2010, which released oil hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico, presented an opportunity to examine whether microbial community composition might provide a sensitive measure of ecosystem disturbance. Samples were collected on four occasions, beginning in mid-June, during initial beach oiling, until mid-November from surface sand and surf zone waters at seven beaches stretching from Bay St. Louis, MS to St. George Island, FL USA. Oil hydrocarbon measurements and NOAA shoreline assessments indicated little to no impact on the two most eastern beaches (controls). Sequence comparisons of bacterial ribosomal RNA gene hypervariable regions isolated from beach sands located to the east and west of Mobile Bay in Alabama demonstrated that regional drivers account for markedly different bacterial communities. Individual beaches had unique community signatures that persisted over time and exhibited spatial relationships, where community similarity decreased as horizontal distance between samples increased from one to hundreds of meters. In contrast, sequence analyses detected larger temporal and less spatial variation among the water samples. Superimposed upon these beach community distance and time relationships, was increased variability in bacterial community composition from oil hydrocarbon contaminated sands. The increased variability was observed among the core, resident, and transient community members, indicating the occurrence of community-wide impacts rather than solely an overprinting of oil hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria onto otherwise relatively stable sand population structures. Among sequences classified to genus, Alcanivorax, Alteromonas, Marinobacter, Winogradskyella, and Zeaxanthinibacter exhibited the largest relative abundance increases in oiled sands.","2013-09-10","2016-07-20 17:24:51","2016-07-20 17:24:51","2016-07-20 17:24:51","","","9","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24040219 PMCID: PMC3769389","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\5TD93EWG\Newton et al. - 2013 - Shifts in the Microbial Community Composition of G.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769389/","G-2010-12-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ability to generate 105–108 reads with relative ease brings with it many downstream complications. Beyond the computational resources and skills needed to process and analyze data, it is difficult to compare datasets in an intuitive and interactive manner that leads to hypothesis generation and testing. Results We developed the free web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu) to address these challenges and to facilitate research by individuals or collaborating groups working on projects with large-scale sequencing data. Users can upload marker gene sequences and associated metadata; reads are quality filtered and assigned to both taxonomic structures and to taxonomy-independent clusters. A simple point-and-click interface allows users to select for analysis any combination of their own or their collaborators’ private data and data from public projects, filter these by their choice of taxonomic and/or abundance criteria, and then explore these data using a wide range of analytic methods and visualizations. Each result is extensively hyperlinked to other analysis and visualization options, promoting data exploration and leading to a greater understanding of data relationships. Conclusions VAMPS allows researchers using marker gene sequence data to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download data, results, and images for publication. VAMPS obviates the need for individual research groups to make the considerable investment in computational infrastructure and bioinformatic support otherwise necessary to process, analyze, and interpret massive amounts of next-generation sequence data.

Computational approaches that rely on pairwise sequence alignments for similarity assessment and de novo clustering with de facto similarity thresholds to partition high-throughput sequencing datasets constrain fine-scale resolution descriptions of microbial communities. Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) provides a computationally efficient means to partition marker gene datasets into ‘MED nodes', which represent homogeneous operational taxonomic units. By employing Shannon entropy, MED uses only the information-rich nucleotide positions across reads and iteratively partitions large datasets while omitting stochastic variation. When applied to analyses of microbiomes from two deep-sea cryptic sponges Hexadella dedritifera and Hexadella cf. dedritifera, MED resolved a key Gammaproteobacteria cluster into multiple MED nodes that are specific to different sponges, and revealed that these closely related sympatric sponge species maintain distinct microbial communities. MED analysis of a previously published human oral microbiome dataset also revealed that taxa separated by less than 1% sequence variation distributed to distinct niches in the oral cavity.

A significant enrichment of distinct microbial populations was observed, yet, little is known about the abundance and richness of specific microbial ecotypes involved in gas, oil and dispersant biodegradation in the wake of oil spills. Here, we document a previously unrecognized diversity of closely related taxa affiliating with Cycloclasticus, Colwellia and Oceanospirillaceae and describe their spatio-temporal distribution in the Gulf's deepwater, in close proximity to the discharge site and at increasing distance from it, before, during and after the discharge. A highly sensitive, computational method (oligotyping) applied to a data set generated from 454-tag pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V4-V6 regions, enabled the detection of population dynamics at the sub-operational taxonomic unit level (0.2% sequence similarity). The biogeochemical signature of the deep-sea samples was assessed via total cell counts, concentrations of short-chain alkanes (C1-C5), nutrients, (colored) dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, as well as methane oxidation rates. Statistical analysis elucidated environmental factors that shaped ecologically relevant dynamics of oligotypes, which likely represent distinct ecotypes. Major hydrocarbon degraders, adapted to the slow-diffusive natural hydrocarbon seepage in the Gulf of Mexico, appeared unable to cope with the conditions encountered during the DWH spill or were outcompeted.

The disease cystic fibrosis (CF) often involves chronic airway colonization by bacteria and fungi, and these infections cause irreversible lung damage. Fungi are detected more frequently in CF sputum samples upon initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and several studies have implicated the detection of fungi in sputum with worse outcomes. Thus, a more complete understanding of fungi in CF is required. Results We characterized the fungi and bacteria in expectorated sputa from six CF subjects. Samples were collected upon admission for systemic antibacterial therapy and upon the completion of treatment and analyzed using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and bacterial 16S rDNA sequences. A mixture of Candida species and Malassezia dominated the mycobiome in all samples (74%–99% of fungal reads). There was not a striking trend correlating fungal and bacterial richness, and richness showed a decline after antibiotic therapy particularly for the bacteria. The fungal communities within a sputum sample resembled other samples from that subject despite the aggressive antibacterial therapy. Quantitative PCR analysis of fungal 18S rDNA sequences to assess fungal burden showed variation in fungal density in sputum before and after antibacterial therapy but no consistent directional trend. Analysis of Candida ITS1 sequences amplified from sputum or pure culture-derived genomic DNA from individual Candida species found little (<0.5%) or no variation in ITS1 sequences within or between strains, thereby validating this locus for the purpose of Candida species identification. We also report the enhancement of the publically available Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) tool for the analysis of fungal communities in clinical samples. Conclusions Fungi are present in CF respiratory sputum. In CF, the use of intravenous antibiotic therapy often does not profoundly impact bacterial community structure, and we observed a similar stability in fungal species composition. Further studies are required to predict the effects of antibacterials on fungal burden in CF and fungal community stability in non-CF populations.","2014-11-03","2016-07-22 15:35:51","2016-07-22 15:35:51","2016-07-22 15:35:51","40","","","2","","Microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25408892 PMCID: PMC4236224","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\QF5K6Q23\Willger et al. - 2014 - Characterization and quantification of the fungal .pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236224/","G-2007-6-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology/Principal Findings The synthesis of 9.6 million bacterial V6-rRNA amplicons for 509 samples that span the global ocean's surface to the deep-sea floor shows that pelagic and benthic communities greatly differ, at all taxonomic levels, and share <10% bacterial types defined at 3% sequence similarity level. Surface and deep water, coastal and open ocean, and anoxic and oxic ecosystems host distinct communities that reflect productivity, land influences and other environmental constraints such as oxygen availability. The high variability of bacterial community composition specific to vent and coastal ecosystems reflects the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of these habitats. Both pelagic and benthic bacterial community distributions correlate with surface water productivity, reflecting the coupling between both realms by particle export. Also, differences in physical mixing may play a fundamental role in the distribution patterns of marine bacteria, as benthic communities showed a higher dissimilarity with increasing distance than pelagic communities.

This study examined the distribution, relative abundance, and diversity of Epsilonproteobacteria in 14 low-temperature vent fluids from five volcanically active seamounts of the Mariana Arc using a 454 tag sequencing approach. Most vent fluids were enriched in cell concentrations compared with background seawater, and quantitative PCR results indicated that all fluids were dominated by bacteria. Operational taxonomic unit-based statistical tools applied to 454 data show that all vents from the northern end of the Mariana Arc grouped together, to the exclusion of southern arc seamounts, which were as distinct from one another as they were from northern seamounts. Statistical analysis also showed a significant relationship between seamount and individual vent groupings, suggesting that community membership may be linked to geographical isolation and not geochemical parameters. However, while there may be large-scale geographic differences, distance is not the distinguishing factor in the microbial community composition. At the local scale, most vents host a distinct population of Epsilonproteobacteria, regardless of seamount location. This suggests that there may be barriers to exchange and dispersal for these vent endemic microorganisms at hydrothermal seamounts of the Mariana Arc.","2010-09-01","2016-07-22 15:46:06","2016-07-22 15:46:06","2016-07-22 15:46:06","538-549","","3","73","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Contaminating bacterial DNA in reagents creates a practical limit on the use of PCR to detect dilute bacterial DNA in environmental or public health samples. The most pernicious source of contamination is microbial DNA in DNA polymerase preparations. Importantly, all commercial Taq polymerase preparations inevitably contain contaminating microbial DNA. Removal of DNA from an enzyme preparation is problematical. Methodology/Principal Findings This report demonstrates that the background of contaminating DNA detected by quantitative PCR with broad host range primers can be decreased greater than 10-fold through the simple expedient of Taq enzyme dilution, without altering detection of target microbes in samples. The general method is: For any thermostable polymerase used for high-sensitivity detection, do a dilution series of the polymerase crossed with a dilution series of DNA or bacteria that work well with the test primers. For further work use the concentration of polymerase that gave the least signal in its negative control (H2O) while also not changing the threshold cycle for dilutions of spiked DNA or bacteria compared to higher concentrations of Taq polymerase. Conclusions/Significance It is clear from the studies shown in this report that a straightforward procedure of optimizing the Taq polymerase concentration achieved “treatment-free” attenuation of interference by contaminating bacterial DNA in Taq polymerase preparations. This procedure should facilitate detection and quantification with broad host range primers of a small number of bona fide bacteria (as few as one) in a sample.","2009-09-15","2016-07-22 15:51:43","2017-08-14 22:29:15","2016-07-22 15:51:43","","","9","4","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 19753123 PMCID: PMC2737620","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\SSD6UFV6\Spangler et al. - 2009 - Optimizing Taq Polymerase Concentration for Improv.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737620/","G-B2007-60 TR09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aim to better understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying this usual “barcode gap” pattern. We employ avian barcode libraries to test a central prediction of neutral theory, namely, intraspecific variation equals 2 Nµ, where N is population size and µ is mutations per site per generation. Birds are uniquely suited for this task: they have the best-known species limits, are well represented in barcode libraries, and, most critically, are the only large group with documented census population sizes. In addition, we ask if mitochondrial molecular clock measurements conform to neutral theory prediction of clock rate equals µ. Results Intraspecific COI barcode variation was uniformly low regardless of census population size (n = 142 species in 15 families). Apparent outliers reflected lumping of reproductively isolated populations or hybrid lineages. Re-analysis of a published survey of cytochrome b variation in diverse birds (n = 93 species in 39 families) further confirmed uniformly low intraspecific variation. Hybridization/gene flow among species/populations was the main limitation to DNA barcode identification. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge, this is the first large study of animal mitochondrial diversity using actual census population sizes and the first to test outliers for population structure. Our finding of universally low intraspecific variation contradicts a central prediction of neutral theory and is not readily accounted for by commonly proposed ad hoc modifications. We argue that the weight of evidence–low intraspecific variation and the molecular clock–indicates neutral evolution plays a minor role in mitochondrial sequence evolution. As an alternate paradigm consistent with empirical data, we propose extreme purifying selection, including at synonymous sites, limits variation within species and continuous adaptive selection drives the molecular clock.","2014-07-02","2016-07-22 15:55:29","2017-08-14 22:28:36","2016-07-22 15:55:29","","","7","9","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24988408 PMCID: PMC4079456","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\WV8K7GZX\Stoeckle and Thaler - 2014 - DNA Barcoding Works in Practice but Not in (Neutra.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079456/","G-B2007-60 TR09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Humans remain largely pre-Neolithic in our relationship with microbes but starting with the gut we continue our hundred-year project of approaching the ability to assess and cultivate benign microbiomes in our bodies. Buildings are analogous to the body and it is time to ask what it means to cultivate benign microbiomes in our built environment. A critical distinction is that we have not found, or invented, niches in buildings where healthful microbial metabolism occurs and/or could be cultivated. Key events affecting the health and healthfulness of buildings such as a hurricane leading to a flood or a burst pipe occur only rarely and unpredictably. The cause may be transient but the effects can be long lasting and, e.g., for moisture damage, cumulative. Non-invasive “building tomography” could find moisture and “sentinel microbes” could record the integral of transient growth. “Seed” microbes are metabolically inert cells able to grow when conditions allow. All microbes and their residue present actinic molecules including immunological epitopes (molecular shapes). The fascinating hygiene and microbial biodiversity hypotheses propose that a healthy immune system requires exposure to a set of microbial epitopes that is rich in diversity. A particular conjecture is that measures of the richness of diversity derived from microbiome next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be mechanistically coupled to—rather than merely correlated with some measures of—human health. These hypotheses and conjectures inspire workers and funders but an alternative is also consequent to the first Neolithic revolution: That the genetic uniformity of contemporary foods may also decrease human exposure to molecular biodiversity in a heath-relevant manner. Understanding the consequences—including the unintended consequences of the first Neolithic revolution—will inform and help us benignly implement the second—the microbial—Neolithic revolution.","2016-03-29","2016-07-22 15:57:13","2017-08-14 22:29:52","2016-07-22 15:57:13","","","","4","","Microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27021307 PMCID: PMC4810507","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\A9QUGGZV\Thaler - 2016 - Toward a microbial Neolithic revolution in buildin.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4810507/","G-B2007-60 TR09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In buildings, moisture parameters can be classified by location and include assessments of moisture in the air, at a surface, or within a material. These parameters are not equivalent in dynamic indoor environments, which makes moisture-induced fungal growth in buildings a complex occurrence. In order to determine the circumstances that lead to such growth, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of in situ moisture measurement, the influence of building factors on moisture parameters, and the levels of these moisture parameters that lead to indoor fungal growth. Currently, there are disagreements in the literature on this topic. A literature review was conducted specifically on moisture-induced fungal growth on gypsum drywall. This review revealed that there is no consistent measurement approach used to characterize moisture in laboratory and field studies, with relative humidity measurements being most common. Additionally, many studies identify a critical moisture value, below which fungal growth will not occur. The values defined by relative humidity encompassed the largest range, while those defined by moisture content exhibited the highest variation. Critical values defined by equilibrium relative humidity were most consistent, and this is likely due to equilibrium relative humidity being the most relevant moisture parameter to microbial growth, since it is a reasonable measure of moisture available at surfaces, where fungi often proliferate. Several sources concur that surface moisture, particularly liquid water, is the prominent factor influencing microbial changes and that moisture in the air and within a material are of lesser importance. However, even if surface moisture is assessed, a single critical moisture level to prevent fungal growth cannot be defined, due to a number of factors, including variations in fungal genera and/or species, temperature, and nutrient availability. Despite these complexities, meaningful measurements can still be made to inform fungal growth by making localised, long-term, and continuous measurements of surface moisture. Such an approach will capture variations in a material’s surface moisture, which could provide insight on a number of conditions that could lead to fungal proliferation.","2015-12-08","2016-07-22 16:01:35","2016-07-22 16:01:35","2016-07-22 16:01:35","","","","3","","Microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26642923 PMCID: PMC4672539","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\VTDEMGQR\Dedesko and Siegel - 2015 - Moisture parameters and fungal communities associa.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4672539/","G-2014-13591","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The isolated strains were identified as W. sebi and W. muriae. Previous studies suggested that the W. sebi phylogenetic clade contained cryptic species but conclusive evidence was lacking because only the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) marker was analyzed. The ITS and four protein-coding genes (MCM7, RPB1, RPB2, and TSR1) were sequenced for 85 isolates. Based on an initial neighbor joining analysis of the concatenated genes, W. muriae remained monophyletic but four clades were found in W. sebi, which we designated as W. sebi clades 1, 2, 3, and 4. We hypothesized that these clades represent distinct phylogenetic species within the Wallemia sebi species complex (WSSC). We then conducted multiple phylogenetic analyses and demonstrated genealogical concordance, which supports the existence of four phylogenetic species within the WSSC.

A review","Environmental Science & Technology","","1520-5851","10.1021/es402455r","","Opportunistic pathogens occurring in premise (i.e., building) plumbing systems, including strains of Legionella, Mycobacterium, Acanthamoeba, and Pseudomonas, are now frequently cited agents of waterborne disease outbreaks. Unlike traditional fecal pathogens, opportunistic pathogens are part of the drinking water microbial ecology and therefore require new paradigms for their control. With the onset of the ""microbiome era"", notions of eradicating all microbes in drinking water have proven unrealistic, making a probiotic concept worthy of consideration. Research is needed to better understand how engineering controls may individually, or in combination, select for a desirable microbiome, and how the microbiome itself may mediate proliferation of opportunistic pathogens. Ecological interactions such as competition, antagonism, and obligate parasite-host relationships offer potential targets for probiotic control of opportunistic pathogens. A probiotic approach may be defined as intentional inoculation of beneficial microbes or choosing conditions that select for a desirable microbiome. This critical review synthesizes the state of the knowledge of the factors governing opportunistic pathogen control in premise plumbing and potential opportunities for and barriers to implementation of a probiotic approach. Future effort is recommended to demonstrate the feasibility of the probiotic concept; to develop effective, practical, and safe protocols; and to engage relevant stakeholders in evaluating options and assessing corresponding risks.","2013-09-17","2016-07-22 16:26:03","2016-07-22 16:26:03","","10117-10128","","18","47","","Environ.

Here we investigated the effects of prior granular activated carbon (GAC) biofiltration [GAC-filtered water, unfiltered water, and a blend (30% GAC filtered and 70% unfiltered water)] and disinfectant type (chlorine, chloramine) on opportunistic pathogen occurrence using five annular reactors (ARs) to simulate water distribution systems, particularly premise plumbing. GAC pre-treatment effectively reduced total organic carbon (TOC), resulting in three levels of influent TOC investigated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) provided molecular evidence of natural colonization of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Hartmannella vermiformis and Mycobacterium avium on AR coupons. Cultivable mycobacteria and amoeba, including pathogenic species, were also found in bulk water and biofilm samples. While q-PCR tends to overestimate live cells, it provided a quantitative comparison of target organisms colonizing the AR biofilms in terms of gene copy numbers. In most cases, total bacteria and opportunistic pathogens were higher in the three undisinfected ARs, but the levels were not proportional to the level of GAC pre-treatment/TOC. Chlorine was more effective for controlling mycobacteria and Acanthamoeba, whereas chloramine was more effective for controlling Legionella. Both chlorine and chloramine effectively inhibited M. avium and H. vermiformis colonization. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes in coupon biofilms revealed a significant effect of GAC pre-treatment and disinfectant type on the microbial community structure. Overall, this study provides insights into the potential of different disinfectants and GAC biofilters at the treatment plant and in buildings to control downstream opportunistic pathogens and broader drinking water microbial communities.","2013-10-01","2016-07-22 16:26:41","2016-07-22 16:26:41","","5760-5772","","15","47","","Water Res.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23906775","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23906775","G-2012-5-41 MBRP","Water Microbiology; Mycobacterium; Acanthamoeba; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Pyrosequencing; Charcoal; Chlorine; Disinfectants; Hartmannella; GAC; Water Purification; Annular reactor; Disinfectant; Chloramines; q-PCR; Amoeba; Filtration; Legionella; Mycobacteria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent microbiome research is bringing new understanding to the true extent and diversity of microbes that inhabit water distribution systems. The purpose of this study was to determine how water chemistry in main distribution lines shape the microbiome in drinking water biofilms and to explore potential associations between opportunistic pathogens and indigenous drinking water microbes. Effects of disinfectant (chloramines, chlorine), water age (2.3 days, 5.7 days), and pipe material (cement, iron, PVC) were compared in parallel triplicate simulated water distribution systems. Pyrosequencing was employed to characterize bacteria and terminal restriction fragment polymorphism was used to profile both bacteria and eukaryotes inhabiting pipe biofilms. Disinfectant and water age were both observed to be strong factors in shaping bacterial and eukaryotic community structures. Pipe material only influenced the bacterial community structure (ANOSIM test, P < 0.05). Interactive effects of disinfectant, pipe material, and water age on both bacteria and eukaryotes were noted. Disinfectant concentration had the strongest effect on bacteria, while dissolved oxygen appeared to be a major driver for eukaryotes (BEST test). Several correlations of similarity metrics among populations of bacteria, eukaryotes, and opportunistic pathogens, as well as one significant association between mycobacterial and proteobacterial operational taxonomic units, provides insight into means by which manipulating the microbiome may lead to new avenues for limiting the growth of opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Legionella) or other nuisance organisms (e.g., nitrifiers).","2014","2016-07-22 16:28:52","2016-07-22 16:28:52","","1426-1435","","3","48","","Environ.

This study characterized occurrence of nitrifying populations before, during and after a chlorine burn at 46 sites in a chloraminated distribution system with varying pipe materials and levels of observed nitrification. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene markers present in nitrifying populations indicated higher frequency of detection of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (72% of samples) relative to ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) (28% of samples). Nitrospira nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were detected at 45% of samples, while presence of Nitrobacter NOB could not be confirmed at any of the samples. During the chlorine burn, the numbers of AOA, AOB, and Nitrospira greatly reduced (i.e., 0.8-2.4 log). However, rapid and continued regrowth of AOB and Nitrospira were observed along with nitrite production in the bulk water within four months after the chlorine burn, and nitrification outbreaks appeared to worsen 6-12 months later, even after adopting a twice annual burn program. Although high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed a distinct community shift and higher diversity index during the chlorine burn, it steadily returned towards a condition more similar to pre-burn than burn stage. Significant factors associated with nitrifier and microbial community composition included water age and sampling location type, but not pipe material. Overall, these results indicate that there is limited long-term effect of chlorine burns on nitrifying populations and the broader microbial community.","2014-09-16","2016-07-22 16:30:35","2016-07-22 16:30:35","","10624-10633","","18","48","","Environ.

High throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was employed to profile and compare the resident bulk water bacteria and archaea. The utility, location of the pipe rig, pipe material and stagnation all had a significant influence on the plumbing microbiome composition, but the utility source water and treatment practices were dominant factors. Examination of 21 water chemistry parameters suggested that the total chlorine concentration, pH, P, SO42- and Mg were associated with the most of the variation in bulk water microbiome composition. Disinfectant type exerted a notably low-magnitude impact on microbiome composition. At two utilities using the same source water, slight differences in treatment approaches were associated with differences in rare taxa in samples.

The interplay between disinfectant type (chlorine or chloramine), water age (2.3-5.7 days) and materials (polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cement or iron) in upstream simulated distribution systems (SDSs) profoundly influenced levels of pathogen gene markers in corresponding SWH bulk waters. For example, Legionella spp. were 3-4 log higher in SWHs receiving water from chloraminated vs chlorinated SDSs, because of disinfectant decay from nitrification. By contrast, SWHs fed with chlorinated PVC SDS water not only harbored the lowest levels of all pathogen markers, but effluent from the chlorinated SWHs were even lower than influent levels in several instances (e.g., 2 log less Legionella spp. and NTM for PVC and 3-5 log less P. aeruginosa for cement). However, pathogen gene marker influent levels correlated positively to effluent levels in the SWHs (P < 0.05).

Our objective was to conduct a controlled, replicated pilot-scale investigation to address this knowledge gap using continuously recirculating water heaters to examine five water heater set points (39–58 °C) under three water use conditions. We hypothesized that L. pneumophila levels at the tap depend on the collective influence of water heater temperature, flow frequency, and the resident plumbing ecology. Results We confirmed temperature setting to be a critical factor in suppressing L. pneumophila growth both in continuously recirculating hot water lines and at distal taps. For example, at 51 °C, planktonic L. pneumophila in recirculating lines was reduced by a factor of 28.7 compared to 39 °C and was prevented from re-colonizing biofilm. However, L. pneumophila still persisted up to 58 °C, with evidence that it was growing under the conditions of this study. Further, exposure to 51 °C water in a low-use tap appeared to optimally select for L. pneumophila (e.g., 125 times greater numbers than in high-use taps). We subsequently explored relationships among L. pneumophila and other ecologically relevant microbes, noting that elevated temperature did not have a general disinfecting effect in terms of total bacterial numbers. We documented the relationship between L. pneumophila and Legionella spp., and noted several instances of correlations with Vermamoeba vermiformis, and generally found that there is a dynamic relationship with this amoeba host over the range of temperatures and water use frequencies examined. Conclusions Our study provides a new window of understanding into the microbial ecology of potable hot water systems and helps to resolve past discrepancies in the literature regarding the influence of water temperature and stagnation on L. pneumophila, which is the cause of a growing number of outbreaks. This work is especially timely, given society’s movement towards “green” buildings and the need to reconcile innovations in building design with public health.

The goal of this study was to determine qPCR accuracy, precision, and method detection limits (MDLs) within the context of indoor and ambient aerosol samples. Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus vegetative bacterial cells and Aspergillus fumigatus fungal spores loaded onto aerosol filters were considered. Efficiencies associated with recovery of DNA from aerosol filters were low, and excluding these efficiencies in quantitative analysis led to underestimating the true aerosol concentration by 10 to 24 times. Precision near detection limits ranged from a 28% to 79% coefficient of variation (COV) for the three test organisms, and the majority of this variation was due to instrument repeatability. Depending on the organism and sampling filter material, precision results suggest that qPCR is useful for determining dissimilarity between two samples only if the true differences are greater than 1.3 to 3.2 times (95% confidence level at n = 7 replicates). For MDLs, qPCR was able to produce a positive response with 99% confidence from the DNA of five B. atrophaeus cells and less than one A. fumigatus spore. Overall MDL values that included sample processing efficiencies ranged from 2,000 to 3,000 B. atrophaeus cells per filter and 10 to 25 A. fumigatus spores per filter. Applying the concepts of accuracy, precision, and MDL to qPCR aerosol measurements demonstrates that sample processing efficiencies must be accounted for in order to accurately estimate bioaerosol exposure, provides guidance on the necessary statistical rigor required to understand significant differences among separate aerosol samples, and prevents undetected (i.e., nonquantifiable) values for true aerosol concentrations that may be significant.","2010-11","2016-07-25 16:57:17","2016-07-25 16:57:17","2016-07-25 16:57:17","7004-7012","","21","76","","Appl Environ Microbiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20817798 PMCID: PMC2976253","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\PDN6K4IU\Hospodsky et al. - 2010 - Accuracy, Precision, and Method Detection Limits o.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976253/","G-2007-12-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although exposure to fungal allergens is considered a strong risk factor for asthma prevalence and severity, limitations in tracking fungal diversity in air have thus far prevented a clear understanding of their human pathogenic properties. This study used a cascade impactor for sampling, and quantitative real-time PCR plus 454 pyrosequencing for analysis to investigate seasonal, size-resolved fungal communities in outdoor air in an urban setting in the northeastern United States. From the 20 libraries produced with an average of ∼800 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences (total 15 326 reads), 12 864 and 11 280 sequences were determined to the genus and species levels, respectively, and 558 different genera and 1172 different species were identified, including allergens and infectious pathogens. These analyses revealed strong relationships between fungal aerodynamic diameters and features of taxonomic compositions. The relative abundance of airborne allergenic fungi ranged from 2.8% to 10.7% of total airborne fungal taxa, peaked in the fall, and increased with increasing aerodynamic diameter. Fungi that can cause invasive fungal infections peaked in the spring, comprised 0.1–1.6% of fungal taxa and typically increased in relative abundance with decreasing aerodynamic diameter. Atmospheric fungal ecology is a strong function of aerodynamic diameter, whereby through physical processes, the size influences the diversity of airborne fungi that deposit in human airways and the efficiencies with which specific groups of fungi partition from outdoor air to indoor environments.","2012-10","2016-07-25 16:59:14","2017-08-14 22:29:16","2016-07-25 16:59:14","1801-1811","","10","6","","ISME J","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22476354 PMCID: PMC3446800","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\CQ3ZVRR2\Yamamoto et al. - 2012 - Particle-size distributions and seasonal diversity.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3446800/","G-2011-6-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we describe an open source software program ""FHiTINGS"" that utilizes the output of a BLASTn (blastall) search to rapidly identify, classify, and parse internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequences produced in fungal ecology studies that utilize next-generation DNA sequencing. This tool was designed for use with 454 pyrosequencing and is also appropriate for use with any sequencing platform that allows for BLAST searches against the indicated ITS database. For each sequence, FHiTINGS uses the lowest common ancestor method (LCA) to produce a single identification from BLAST output results, and then assigns taxonomic ranks from species through kingdom when possible for each sequence based on the Index Fungorum database. The program then sums and sorts this data into tabular form to enable rapid analysis of the sample, including α-diversity measures or richness. In silico testing demonstrates the time required to analyze and classify 1000 sequences is reduced from over 2 h by manual sorting to <1 min of computational time when using FHiTINGS, and that the classification output from the software is consistent with that derived from manual sorting of the data.","2014-04","2016-07-25 17:00:54","2016-07-25 17:00:54","","315-321","","4","54","","J.

Specifically, we evaluated the accuracy of the BLASTn-based identification for internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences generated from pure cultures, and quantified the reproducibility of relative abundances as well as α and β diversity measurements using duplicated environmental samples. The BLASTn-based method produced accurate fungal identification for the pure culture sequences at the genus rank. Percentages of the sequences assigned to correct genera were 99.8%, 99.8% and 99.9% for Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Epicoccum nigrum respectively. These fractions were smaller for Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium chrysogenum, which have dual nomenclatures or sibling species that are indistinguishable by ITS sequences. Our duplicate environmental analyses demonstrated that α diversity and relative abundance levels were reproducible (r(2)  > 0.9), that variability decreases with increased sequence quantity, and that the differences in distinct environmental samples were larger than differences in replicate samples (β diversity). These results serve to better characterize the identification and quantification limits of ITS-based fungal taxonomic studies, and demonstrate that while diversity quantification is reproducible, limitations in ITS-based taxonomic identification and dual nomenclature conventions are current barriers to identification accuracy.","2014-09","2016-07-25 17:11:48","2016-07-25 17:11:48","","2764-2776","","9","16","","Environ.

We explored the biogeographical patterns exhibited by bacteria across ten surfaces within each of twelve public restrooms. Using high-throughput barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, we identified 19 bacterial phyla across all surfaces. Most sequences belonged to four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The communities clustered into three general categories: those found on surfaces associated with toilets, those on the restroom floor, and those found on surfaces routinely touched with hands. On toilet surfaces, gut-associated taxa were more prevalent, suggesting fecal contamination of these surfaces. Floor surfaces were the most diverse of all communities and contained several taxa commonly found in soils. Skin-associated bacteria, especially the Propionibacteriaceae, dominated surfaces routinely touched with our hands. Certain taxa were more common in female than in male restrooms as vagina-associated Lactobacillaceae were widely distributed in female restrooms, likely from urine contamination. Use of the SourceTracker algorithm confirmed many of our taxonomic observations as human skin was the primary source of bacteria on restroom surfaces. Overall, these results demonstrate that restroom surfaces host relatively diverse microbial communities dominated by human-associated bacteria with clear linkages between communities on or in different body sites and those communities found on restroom surfaces. More generally, this work is relevant to the public health field as we show that human-associated microbes are commonly found on restroom surfaces suggesting that bacterial pathogens could readily be transmitted between individuals by the touching of surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can use high-throughput analyses of bacterial communities to determine sources of bacteria on indoor surfaces, an approach which could be used to track pathogen transmission and test the efficacy of hygiene practices.","2011-11-23","2016-08-01 16:07:36","2016-08-01 16:07:36","2016-08-01 16:07:36","","","11","6","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 22132229 PMCID: PMC3223236","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\UJ9A6R57\Flores et al. - 2011 - Microbial Biogeography of Public Restroom Surfaces.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223236/","G-2011-3-02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we lack a comprehensive view of the potential effects of differing farming practices on the bacterial communities to which consumers are exposed. We addressed these knowledge gaps by assessing bacterial community structure on conventional and organic analogs of eleven store-bought produce types using a culture-independent approach, 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Our results demonstrated that the fruits and vegetables harbored diverse bacterial communities, and the communities on each produce type were significantly distinct from one another. However, certain produce types (i.e., sprouts, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, and strawberries) tended to share more similar communities as they all had high relative abundances of taxa belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae when compared to the other produce types (i.e., apples, peaches, grapes, and mushrooms) which were dominated by taxa belonging to the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla. Although potentially driven by factors other than farming practice, we also observed significant differences in community composition between conventional and organic analogs within produce types. These differences were often attributable to distinctions in the relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae taxa, which were generally less abundant in organically-grown produce. Taken together, our results suggest that humans are exposed to substantially different bacteria depending on the types of fresh produce they consume with differences between conventionally and organically farmed varieties contributing to this variation.","2013-03-27","2016-08-01 16:11:56","2016-08-01 16:11:56","2016-08-01 16:11:56","","","3","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23544058 PMCID: PMC3609859","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\5WIMBZI7\Leff and Fierer - 2013 - Bacterial Communities Associated with the Surfaces.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609859/","G-2011-3-02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to explore biogeographical patterns of bacteria across > 80 surfaces within the kitchens of each of four households. In total, 34 bacterial and two archaeal phyla were identified, with most sequences belonging to the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Genera known to contain common food-borne pathogens were low in abundance but broadly distributed throughout the kitchens, with different taxa exhibiting distinct distribution patterns. The most diverse communities were associated with infrequently cleaned surfaces such as fans above stoves, refrigerator/freezer door seals and floors. In contrast, the least diverse communities were observed in and around sinks, which were dominated by biofilm-forming Gram-negative lineages. Community composition was influenced by conditions on individual surfaces, usage patterns and dispersal from source environments. Human skin was the primary source of bacteria across all kitchen surfaces, with contributions from food and faucet water dominating in a few specific locations. This study demonstrates that diverse bacterial communities are widely distributed in residential kitchens and that the composition of these communities is often predictable. These results also illustrate the ease with which human- and food-associated bacteria can be transferred in residential settings to kitchen surfaces.","2013-02","2016-08-01 16:13:21","2016-08-01 16:13:21","","588-596","","2","15","","Environ.

Here we examined the diversity of bacterial communities found in nine distinct locations within each of forty homes in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that each of the sampled locations harbored bacterial communities that were distinct from one another with surfaces that are regularly cleaned typically harboring lower levels of diversity than surfaces that are cleaned infrequently. These location-specific differences in bacterial communities could be directly related to usage patterns and differences in the likely sources of bacteria dispersed onto these locations. Finally, we examined whether the variability across homes in bacterial diversity could be attributed to outdoor environmental factors, indoor habitat structure, or the occupants of the home. We found that the presence of dogs had a significant effect on bacterial community composition in multiple locations within homes as the homes occupied by dogs harbored more diverse communities and higher relative abundances of dog-associated bacterial taxa. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the types of bacteria deposited on surfaces outside the home and those found inside the home, highlighting that microbes from outside the home can have a direct effect on the microbial communities living on surfaces within our homes.

Such palynological approaches have important limitations as they require time-consuming identification of pollen grains, a priori knowledge of plant species distributions, and a sufficient diversity of pollen types to permit spatial or temporal identification. We demonstrate an alternative approach based on DNA sequencing analyses of the fungal diversity found in dust samples. Using nearly 1,000 dust samples collected from across the continental U.S., our analyses identify up to 40,000 fungal taxa from these samples, many of which exhibit a high degree of geographic endemism. We develop a statistical learning algorithm via discriminant analysis that exploits this geographic endemicity in the fungal diversity to correctly identify samples to within a few hundred kilometers of their geographic origin with high probability. In addition, our statistical approach provides a measure of certainty for each prediction, in contrast with current palynology methods that are almost always based on expert opinion and devoid of statistical inference. Fungal taxa found in dust samples can therefore be used to identify the origin of that dust and, more importantly, we can quantify our degree of certainty that a sample originated in a particular place. This work opens up a new approach to forensic biology that could be used by scientists to identify the origin of dust or soil samples found on objects, clothing, or archaeological artifacts.","2015-04-13","2016-08-01 16:17:59","2016-08-01 16:17:59","2016-08-01 16:17:59","","","4","10","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 25875229 PMCID: PMC4395444","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\UGGM5KVC\Grantham et al. - 2015 - Fungi Identify the Geographic Origin of Dust Sampl.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4395444/","G-2012-6-03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using culture-independent approaches, we characterized bacterial and fungal communities in homes in Boulder, CO, USA 2-3 months after the historic September, 2013 flooding event. We collected passive air samples from basements in 50 homes (36 flood-damaged, 14 non-flooded), and we sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4-V5 region) and the fungal ITS1 region from these samples for community analyses. Quantitative PCR was used to estimate the abundances of bacteria and fungi in the passive air samples. Results indicate significant differences in bacterial and fungal community composition between flooded and non-flooded homes. Fungal abundances were estimated to be three times higher in flooded, relative to non-flooded homes, but there were no significant differences in bacterial abundances. Penicillium (fungi) and Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae (bacteria) were among the most abundant taxa in flooded homes. Our results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities continue to be affected by flooding, even after relative humidity has returned to baseline levels and remediation has removed any visible evidence of flood damage.","2015-03-03","2016-08-01 16:19:05","2016-08-01 16:19:05","","2675-2684","","5","49","","Environ.

Using settled dust samples from ∼1,200 locations, we generated the first atlas, to our knowledge, of airborne bacterial and fungal distributions across the continental United States. We found that airborne microbial communities, such as terrestrial plants and animals, exhibit nonrandom geographic patterns, and we identified the factors that shape the continental-scale distributions of microbial taxa. Furthermore, we found that the airborne microbes found in urban and more rural areas are not distinct in composition, but the dust-associated communities found in more urbanized areas are more homogeneous across the United States., It has been known for centuries that microorganisms are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, where they are capable of long-distance dispersal. Likewise, it is well-established that these airborne bacteria and fungi can have myriad effects on human health, as well as the health of plants and livestock. However, we have a limited understanding of how these airborne communities vary across different geographic regions or the factors that structure the geographic patterns of near-surface microbes across large spatial scales. We collected dust samples from the external surfaces of ∼1,200 households located across the United States to understand the continental-scale distributions of bacteria and fungi in the near-surface atmosphere. The microbial communities were highly variable in composition across the United States, but the geographic patterns could be explained by climatic and soil variables, with coastal regions of the United States sharing similar airborne microbial communities. Although people living in more urbanized areas were not found to be exposed to distinct outdoor air microbial communities compared with those living in more rural areas, our results do suggest that urbanization leads to homogenization of the airborne microbiota, with more urban communities exhibiting less continental-scale geographic variability than more rural areas.

Phylogenetic data gives us a new insight into these processes, providing a more informative perspective on functional and trait diversity than taxonomic richness alone. But the sheer scale of high resolution phylogenetic data also presents a new challenge to ecological theory. We bring a sampling theory perspective to microbial communities, considering a local community of co-occuring organisms as a sample from a larger regional pool, and apply our framework to make analytical predictions for local phylogenetic diversity arising from a given metacommunity and community assembly process. We characterize community assembly in terms of quantitative descriptions of clustered, random and overdispersed sampling, which have been associated with hypotheses of environmental filtering and competition. Using our approach, we analyze large microbial communities from the human microbiome, uncovering significant variation in diversity across habitats relative to the null hypothesis of random sampling., Microbial diversity analyses have revolutionized our knowledge of the microscopic world, from terrestrial and marine to human and urban environments. This growing field rests on the evolutionary relatedness of organisms, and at its frontier is the inference of ecological processes from phylogenetic diversity. However, the rapidly reducing cost of sequencing means that computational analysis of phylogenetic data is becoming increasingly intractable. We develop a new analytical method to address this issue, providing a computationally-efficient way to compare local phylogenetic diversity to a sample from a regional pool of organisms, under a given ecological process. Our approach has both pragmatic and far-reaching applications. Until now investigators have lacked even an analytical method to compare the diversity of unequally-sized communities without throwing data away, while on a deeper level our theory provides a new framework for connecting phylogenetic data to a wide range of ecological processes. As an application of our approach, we use our methods to distinguish between random, clustered and overdispersed sampling for human microbiome habitats. Finally, we identify a new, phylogenetic analogue of the widely used taxonomic measure of diversity, the Species Abundance Distribution, and we find that it has consistent behavior across microbiome habitats.","2012-12","2016-08-01 16:32:09","2016-08-01 16:32:09","2016-08-01 16:32:09","","","12","8","","PLoS Comput Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23284280 PMCID: PMC3527210","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\U8ZVMDRQ\O'Dwyer et al. - 2012 - Phylogenetic Diversity Theory Sheds Light on the S.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527210/","G-2010-5-22 IEC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to quantify relationships between building attributes and airborne bacterial communities at a health-care facility. We quantified airborne bacterial community structure and environmental conditions in patient rooms exposed to mechanical or window ventilation and in outdoor air. The phylogenetic diversity of airborne bacterial communities was lower indoors than outdoors, and mechanically ventilated rooms contained less diverse microbial communities than did window-ventilated rooms. Bacterial communities in indoor environments contained many taxa that are absent or rare outdoors, including taxa closely related to potential human pathogens. Building attributes, specifically the source of ventilation air, airflow rates, relative humidity and temperature, were correlated with the diversity and composition of indoor bacterial communities. The relative abundance of bacteria closely related to human pathogens was higher indoors than outdoors, and higher in rooms with lower airflow rates and lower relative humidity.

In this study we combined microbiological data with information on the function, form, and organization of spaces from a classroom and office building to understand how design choices influence the biogeography of the built environment microbiome. Results Sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene from dust samples revealed that indoor bacterial communities were extremely diverse, containing more than 32,750 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, 97% sequence similarity cutoff), but most communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Deinococci. Architectural design characteristics related to space type, building arrangement, human use and movement, and ventilation source had a large influence on the structure of bacterial communities. Restrooms contained bacterial communities that were highly distinct from all other rooms, and spaces with high human occupant diversity and a high degree of connectedness to other spaces via ventilation or human movement contained a distinct set of bacterial taxa when compared to spaces with low occupant diversity and low connectedness. Within offices, the source of ventilation air had the greatest effect on bacterial community structure. Conclusions Our study indicates that humans have a guiding impact on the microbial biodiversity in buildings, both indirectly through the effects of architectural design on microbial community structure, and more directly through the effects of human occupancy and use patterns on the microbes found in different spaces and space types.

Despite the ubiquity of bacteria in the atmosphere, little is known about the metabolic functioning of atmospheric bacterial communities. To gain a better understanding of the metabolism of bacterial communities in the atmosphere, we used a combined empirical and model-based approach to investigate the structure and composition of potentially active bacterial communities in air sampled at a high elevation research station. We found that the composition of the putatively active bacterial community (assayed via rRNA) differed significantly from the total bacterial community (assayed via rDNA). Rare taxa in the total (rDNA) community were disproportionately active relative to abundant taxa, and members of the order Rhodospirillales had the highest potential for activity. We developed theory to explore the effects of random sampling from the rRNA and rDNA communities on observed differences between the communities. We found that random sampling, particularly in cases where active taxa are rare in the rDNA community, will give rise to observed differences in community composition including the occurrence of “phantom taxa”, taxa which are detected in the rRNA community but not the rDNA community. We show that the use of comparative rRNA/rDNA techniques can reveal the structure and composition of the metabolically active portion of bacterial communities. Our observations suggest that metabolically active bacteria exist in the atmosphere and that these communities may be involved in the cycling of organic compounds in the atmosphere.","2016-05-24","2016-08-01 16:41:12","2016-08-01 16:41:12","2016-08-01 16:41:12","","","","7","","Front Microbiol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27252689 PMCID: PMC4878314","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\WUPKWI35\Klein et al. - 2016 - Molecular Evidence for Metabolically Active Bacter.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4878314/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While airborne microorganisms are ubiquitous in urban areas, the influence of nearby vegetation on airborne microbial communities remains poorly understood. We examined airborne microbial communities in parks and parking lots in Eugene, Oregon, using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform to identify bacterial taxa, and GIS to measure vegetation cover in buffer zones of different diameters. Our goal was to explore variation among highly vegetated (parks) versus non-vegetated (parking lots) urban environments. A secondary objective was to evaluate passive versus active collection methods for outdoor airborne microbial sampling. Airborne bacterial communities from five parks were different from those of five parking lots (p = 0.023), although alpha diversity was similar. Direct gradient analysis showed that the proportion of vegetated area within a 50 m radius of the sampling station explained 15% of the variation in bacterial community composition. A number of key taxa, including several Acidobacteriaceae were substantially more abundant in parks, while parking lots had higher relative abundance of Acetobacteraceae. Parks had greater beta diversity than parking lots, i.e. individual parks were characterized by unique bacterial signatures, whereas parking lot communities tended to be similar to each other. Although parks and parking lots were selected to form pairs of nearby sites, spatial proximity did not appear to affect compositional similarity. Our results also showed that passive and active collection methods gave comparable results, indicating the “settling dish” method is effective for outdoor airborne sampling. This work sets a foundation for understanding how urban vegetation may impact microbial communities, with potential implications for designing neighborhoods and open space systems that foster better human health.","","2016-08-01 16:42:43","2016-08-01 16:42:43","2016-08-01 16:42:43","","","","","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\UTVRX25J\Mhuireach et al. - Urban greenness influences airborne bacterial comm.pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\5RFUK6M8\S0048969716314826.html","","G-2015-14023","Microorganism; Design; Landscape architecture; Vegetation; built environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we used 16S amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile microbial communities on multiple transit surfaces across train lines and stations in the Boston metropolitan transit system. The greatest determinant of microbial community structure was the transit surface type. In contrast, little variation was observed between geographically distinct train lines and stations serving different demographics. All surfaces were dominated by human skin and oral commensals such as Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. The detected taxa not associated with humans included generalists from alphaproteobacteria, which were especially abundant on outdoor touchscreens. Shotgun metagenomics further identified viral and eukaryotic microbes, including Propionibacterium phage and Malassezia globosa. Functional profiling showed that Propionibacterium acnes pathways such as propionate production and porphyrin synthesis were enriched on train holding surfaces (holds), while electron transport chain components for aerobic respiration were enriched on touchscreens and seats. Lastly, the transit environment was not found to be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Our results suggest that microbial communities on transit surfaces are maintained from a metapopulation of human skin commensals and environmental generalists, with enrichments corresponding to local interactions with the human body and environmental exposures. IMPORTANCE Mass transit environments, specifically, urban subways, are distinct microbial environments with high occupant densities, diversities, and turnovers, and they are thus especially relevant to public health. Despite this, only three culture-independent subway studies have been performed, all since 2013 and all with widely differing designs and conclusions. In this study, we profiled the Boston subway system, which provides 238 million trips per year overseen by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This yielded the first high-precision microbial survey of a variety of surfaces, ridership environments, and microbiological functions (including tests for potential pathogenicity) in a mass transit environment. Characterizing microbial profiles for multiple transit systems will become increasingly important for biosurveillance of antibiotic resistance genes or pathogens, which can be early indicators for outbreak or sanitation events. Understanding how human contact, materials, and the environment affect microbial profiles may eventually allow us to rationally design public spaces to sustain our health in the presence of microbial reservoirs.

In this study, two participants sampled the front and back of their cell phones, four different locations on the soles of their shoes, and the floor beneath them every waking hour over a 2-day period. A further 89 participants took individual samples of their shoes and phones at three different scientific conferences. Results Samples taken from different surface types maintained significantly different microbial community structures. The impact of the floor microbial community on that of the shoe environments was strong and immediate, as evidenced by Procrustes analysis of shoe replicates and significant correlation between shoe and floor samples taken at the same time point. Supervised learning was highly effective at determining which participant had taken a given shoe or phone sample, and a Bayesian method was able to determine which participant had taken each shoe sample based entirely on its similarity to the floor samples. Both shoe and phone samples taken by conference participants clustered into distinct groups based on location, though much more so when an unweighted distance metric was used, suggesting sharing of low-abundance microbial taxa between individuals inhabiting the same space.

Even traditionally outdoor pursuits, such as exercising, are often now performed indoors. Bacteria that colonize these indoor ecosystems are primarily derived from the human microbiome. The modes of human interaction with indoor surfaces and the physical conditions associated with each surface type determine the steady-state ecology of the microbial community. Results Bacterial assemblages associated with different surfaces in three athletic facilities, including floors, mats, benches, free weights, and elliptical handles, were sampled every other hour (8 am to 6 pm) for 2 days. Surface and equipment type had a stronger influence on bacterial community composition than the facility in which they were housed. Surfaces that were primarily in contact with human skin exhibited highly dynamic bacterial community composition and non-random co-occurrence patterns, suggesting that different host microbiomes—shaped by selective forces—were being deposited on these surfaces through time. However, bacterial assemblages found on the floors and mats changed less over time, and species co-occurrence patterns appeared random, suggesting more neutral community assembly. Conclusions These longitudinal patterns highlight the dramatic turnover of microbial communities on surfaces in regular contact with human skin. By uncovering these longitudinal patterns, this study promotes a better understanding of microbe-human interactions within the built environment.

Infected infants have high mortality rates, and survivors often suffer life-long neurological disorders. The causes of many NICU infections go undiagnosed, and there is debate as to the importance of inanimate hospital environments (IHEs) in the spread of infections. We used culture-independent next-generation sequencing to survey bacterial diversity in two San Diego NICUs and to track the sources of microbes in these environments. Thirty IHE samples were collected from two Level-Three NICU facilities. We extracted DNA from these samples and amplified the bacterial small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene sequence using ‘universal’ barcoded primers. The purified PCR products were pooled into a single reaction for pyrosequencing, and the data were analyzed using QIIME. On average, we detected 93+/−39 (mean +/− standard deviation) bacterial genera per sample in NICU IHEs. Many of the bacterial genera included known opportunistic pathogens, and many were skin-associated (e.g., Propionibacterium). In one NICU, we also detected fecal coliform bacteria (Enterobacteriales) in a high proportion of the surface samples. Comparison of these NICU-derived sequences to previously published high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon studies of other indoor environments (offices, restrooms and healthcare facilities), as well as human- and soil-associated environments, found the majority of the NICU samples to be similar to typical building surface and air samples, with the notable exception of the IHEs which were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. Our findings provide evidence that NICU IHEs harbor a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and demonstrate the potential utility of molecular methods for identifying and tracking bacterial diversity in NICUs.","2013-01-23","2016-08-03 17:07:34","2017-08-14 22:28:30","2016-08-03 17:07:34","","","1","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 23372757 PMCID: PMC3553055","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\5H5C86MD\Hewitt et al. - 2013 - Bacterial Diversity in Two Neonatal Intensive Care.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3553055/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the Earth Microbiome Project drives these needs by profiling the genomic content of tens of thousands of samples across multiple environment types. Findings Features of EMPeror include: ability to visualize gradients and categorical data, visualize different principal coordinates axes, present the data in the form of parallel coordinates, show taxa as well as environmental samples, dynamically adjust the size and transparency of the spheres representing the communities on a per-category basis, dynamically scale the axes according to the fraction of variance each explains, show, hide or recolor points according to arbitrary metadata including that compliant with the MIxS family of standards developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium, display jackknifed-resampled data to assess statistical confidence in clustering, perform coordinate comparisons (useful for procrustes analysis plots), and greatly reduce loading times and overall memory footprint compared with existing approaches. Additionally, ease of sharing, given EMPeror’s small output file size, enables agile collaboration by allowing users to embed these visualizations via emails or web pages without the need for extra plugins. Conclusions Here we present EMPeror, an open source and web browser enabled tool with a versatile command line interface that allows researchers to perform rapid exploratory investigations of 3D visualizations of microbial community data, such as the widely used principal coordinates plots. EMPeror includes a rich set of controllers to modify features as a function of the metadata. By being specifically tailored to the requirements of microbial ecologists, EMPeror thus increases the speed with which insight can be gained from large microbiome datasets.","2013-11-26","2016-08-03 17:12:47","2016-08-03 17:12:47","2016-08-03 17:12:47","16","","","2","","Gigascience","EMPeror","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 24280061 PMCID: PMC4076506","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\5TGSKEAI\Vázquez-Baeza et al. - 2013 - EMPeror a tool for visualizing high-throughput mi.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4076506/","G-2010-12-04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While most fungal diversity remains unknown, the development of PCR primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) combined with next-generation sequencing has substantially improved our ability to profile fungal microbial diversity. Although the high sequence variability in the ITS region facilitates more accurate species identification, it also makes multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis unreliable across evolutionarily distant fungi because the sequences are hard to align accurately. To address this issue, we created ghost-tree, a bioinformatics tool that integrates sequence data from two genetic markers into a single phylogenetic tree that can be used for diversity analyses. Our approach starts with a “foundation” phylogeny based on one genetic marker whose sequences can be aligned across organisms spanning divergent taxonomic groups (e.g., fungal families). Then, “extension” phylogenies are built for more closely related organisms (e.g., fungal species or strains) using a second more rapidly evolving genetic marker. These smaller phylogenies are then grafted onto the foundation tree by mapping taxonomic names such that each corresponding foundation-tree tip would branch into its new “extension tree” child. Results We applied ghost-tree to graft fungal extension phylogenies derived from ITS sequences onto a foundation phylogeny derived from fungal 18S sequences. Our analysis of simulated and real fungal ITS data sets found that phylogenetic distances between fungal communities computed using ghost-tree phylogenies explained significantly more variance than non-phylogenetic distances. The phylogenetic metrics also improved our ability to distinguish small differences (effect sizes) between microbial communities, though results were similar to non-phylogenetic methods for larger effect sizes. Conclusions The Silva/UNITE-based ghost tree presented here can be easily integrated into existing fungal analysis pipelines to enhance the resolution of fungal community differences and improve understanding of these communities in built environments. The ghost-tree software package can also be used to develop phylogenetic trees for other marker gene sets that afford different taxonomic resolution, or for bridging genome trees with amplicon trees.

Next-generation DNA sequencing was used to describe fungal and bacterial communities in house dust sampled from 198 homes of asthmatic children in southern New England. Housing characteristics included number of people/children, level of urbanization, single/multifamily home, reported mold, reported water leaks, air conditioning (AC) use, and presence of pets. Both fungal and bacterial community structures were non-random and demonstrated species segregation (C-score, P < 0.00001). Increased microbial richness was associated with the presence of pets, water leaks, longer AC use, suburban (vs. urban) homes, and dust composition measures (P < 0.05). The most significant differences in community composition were observed for AC use and occupancy (people, children, and pets) characteristics. Occupant density measures were associated with beneficial bacterial taxa, including Lactobacillus johnsonii as measured by qPCR.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine associations between exposures to household microbes and childhood asthma severity stratified by atopic status. METHODS: Participants (n = 196) were selected from a cohort of asthmatic children in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Children were grouped according to asthma severity (mild with no or minimal symptoms and medication or moderate to severe persistent) and atopic status (determined by serum IgE levels). Microbial community structure and concentrations in house dust were determined by using next-generation DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between asthma severity and exposure metrics, including richness, taxa identification and quantification, community composition, and concentration of total fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Among all children, increased asthma severity was significantly associated with an increased concentration of summed allergenic fungal species, high total fungal concentrations, and high bacterial richness by using logistic regression in addition to microbial community composition by using the distance comparison t test. Asthma severity in atopic children was associated with fungal community composition (P = .001). By using logistic regression, asthma severity in nonatopic children was associated with total fungal concentration (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.06-5.44). The fungal genus Volutella was associated with increased asthma severity in atopic children (P = .0001, q = 0.04). The yeast genera Kondoa might be protective; Cryptococcus species might also affect asthma severity. CONCLUSION: Asthma severity among this cohort of children was associated with microbial exposure, and associations differed based on atopic status.","2016-07","2016-10-25 13:59:24","2016-10-25 13:59:24","","76-83.e1","","1","138","","J.

Inflammatory responses to physical or psychological stressors are dependent on immunoregulation, which is indicated by a balanced expansion of effector T-cell populations and regulatory T cells. This balance is in part driven by microbial signals. The hygiene or “old friends” hypothesis posits that exposure to immunoregulation-inducing microorganisms is reduced in modern urban societies, leading to an epidemic of inflammatory disease and increased vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. With the global trend toward urbanization, humans are progressively spending more time in built environments, thereby, experiencing limited exposures to these immunoregulatory “old friends.” Here, we evaluate the implications of the global trend toward urbanization, and how this transition may affect human microbial exposures and human behavior.","","2016-10-25 14:06:21","2016-10-25 14:06:21","2016-10-25 14:06:21","","","","","","","The Microbiome of the Built Environment and Human Behavior","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\8H7RXZ4D\Stamper et al. - The Microbiome of the Built Environment and Human .pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\2TZFSZ63\S0074774216301209.html","","G-2015-14165","Urbanization; Biodiversity hypothesis; Microbiome of the built environment; Hygiene hypothesis; Behavior; built environment","Neurobiology, BT  - International Review of","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparisons of infants living in different geographic regions and environmental contexts are needed to aid our understanding of evolutionarily-selected milk adaptations. However, the preservation of fecal samples from individuals in remote locales until they can be processed can be a challenge. Freeze-drying (lyophilization) offers a cost-effective way to preserve some biological samples for transport and analysis at a later date. Currently, it is unknown what, if any, biases are introduced into various analyses by the freeze-drying process. Here, we investigated how freeze-drying affected analysis of two relevant and intertwined aspects of infant fecal samples, marker gene amplicon sequencing of the bacterial community and the fecal oligosaccharide profile (undigested human milk oligosaccharides). No differences were discovered between the fecal oligosaccharide profiles of wet and freeze-dried samples. The marker gene sequencing data showed an increase in proportional representation of Bacteriodes and a decrease in detection of bifidobacteria and members of class Bacilli after freeze-drying. This sample treatment bias may possibly be related to the cell morphology of these different taxa (Gram status). However, these effects did not overwhelm the natural variation among individuals, as the community data still strongly grouped by subject and not by freeze-drying status. We also found that compensating for sample concentration during freeze-drying, while not necessary, was also not detrimental. Freeze-drying may therefore be an acceptable method of sample preservation and mass reduction for some studies of microbial ecology and milk glycan analysis.","2016-01-21","2016-10-25 14:19:41","2017-08-14 22:29:47","2016-10-25 14:19:41","","","","4","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26819854 PMCID: PMC4727960","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\HF2HVJMN\Lewis et al. - 2016 - The impact of freeze-drying infant fecal samples o.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727960/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26819854","G-2014-13740","Fecal microbiome; Freeze-drying; Human microbiome; Human milk oligosaccharides; Infants; Lyophilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Free human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) function as prebiotics by stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria while preventing the binding of harmful bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells. Bacteria have adapted to the glycan-rich environment of the gut by developing enzymes that catabolize glycans. The decrease in HMOs and the increase in glycan digestion products give indications of the active enzymes in the microbial population. In this study, we quantitated the disappearance of intact HMOs and characterized the glycan digestion products in the gut that are produced by the action of microbial enzymes on HMOs and glycoconjugates from breast milk. Oligosaccharides from fecal samples of exclusively breast-fed infants were extracted and profiled using nanoLC-MS. Intact HMOs were found in the fecal samples, additionally, other oligosaccharides were found corresponding to degraded HMOs and non-HMO based compounds. The latter compounds were fragments of N-glycans released through the cleavage of the linkage to the asparagine residue and through cleavage of the chitobiose core of the N-glycan. Marker gene sequencing of the fecal samples revealed bifidobacteria as the dominant inhabitants of the infant gastrointestinal tracts. A glycosidase from Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum was then expressed to digest HMOs in vitro, which showed that the digested oligosaccharides in feces corresponded to the action of glycosidases on HMOs. Similar expression of endoglycosidases also showed that N-glycans were released by bacterial enzymes. Although bifidobacteria may dominate the gut, it is possible that specific minority species are also responsible for the major products observed in feces. Nonetheless, the enzymatic activity correlated well with the known glycosidases in the respective bacteria, suggesting a direct relationship between microbial abundances and catabolic activity.","2016-09","2016-10-25 14:23:00","2017-08-14 22:28:57","","2987-3002","","9","15","","Mol.

Little is known about the sources of indoor airborne particles that contribute to the exposure of premature infants in the NICU environment. In this study, we monitored the spatial and temporal variations of airborne particulate matter concentrations along with other indoor environmental parameters and human occupancy. The experiments were conducted over one year in a private-style NICU. The NICU was served by a central heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system equipped with an economizer and a high-efficiency particle filtration system. The following parameters were measured continuously during weekdays with 1-min resolution: particles larger than 0.3 μm resolved into 6 size groups, CO2 level, dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, and presence or absence of occupants. Altogether, over sixteen periods of a few weeks each, measurements were conducted in rooms occupied with premature infants. In parallel, a second monitoring station was operated in a nearby hallway or at the local nurses’ station. The monitoring data suggest a strong link between indoor particle concentrations and human occupancy. Detected particle peaks from occupancy were clearly discernible among larger particles and imperceptible for submicron (0.3–1 μm) particles. The mean indoor particle mass concentrations averaged across the size range 0.3–10 μm during occupied periods was 1.9 μg/m3, approximately 2.5 times the concentration during unoccupied periods (0.8 μg/m3). Contributions of within-room emissions to total PM10 mass in the baby rooms averaged 37–81%. Near-room indoor emissions and outdoor sources contributed 18–59% and 1–5%, respectively.

The investigation included simultaneous sampling in an unoccupied baby room and in an incubator of an otherwise normally functioning NICU. Background submicron (0.3–1 μm) particle levels in the room were 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than outdoors, owing to high-efficiency particulate filtration of supply air. Airborne supermicron particles were detected in the room; their presence was attributed primarily to emissions from occupant movements. The fraction of in-room PN detected within an infant incubator ranged from 0.2 for particles &gt;10 μm to 0.6 for particles with diameter 0.3–0.5 μm. The incubator humidifier was a strong additional source of particles smaller than 5 μm. Activities by researchers, designed to simulate caregiver visits, were associated with elevated particle concentrations across all measured size ranges, and were particularly discernible among larger particles. Concentrations increased with the number of occupants and with the duration and vigor of activities. The highest levels were observed when fabrics were handled. Against the low background in this environment, even small occupancy-associated perturbations – such as from a brief entry – were discernible.

Recycled water may be used in a spectrum of applications, from irrigation or industrial use to direct potable reuse, and thus presents a challenge to regulators as not all applications require the same level of treatment. We propose that traditional drinking water standards identifying “safe” water quality are insufficient for recycled water and that using the “human exposome” as a framework to guide development of a risk management strategy offers a holistic means by which to base decisions impacting water quality. A successful and comprehensive plan for water reuse must consider 1) health impacts associated with both acute and chronic exposures, 2) all routes of exposure by which individuals may encounter recycled water, and 3) water quality at the true point of use after storage and transport through pipe networks, rather than at the point of treatment. Based on these principles we explore key chemical differences between recycled and traditional potable water, implications for distribution systems with respect to design and operation, occurrence of chronic contaminants, and the presence of emerging and often underappreciated microbial contaminants. The unique nature of recycled water has the potential to provide rapid regrowth conditions for certain microbial contaminants in these systems, which must be considered to achieve safe water quality at the point of use.","2016-07-14","2016-10-26 14:17:35","2016-10-26 14:17:35","2016-10-26 14:17:35","580-598","","4","2","","Environ.

Implementation of decentralized systems, such as rainwater-harvesting technologies and strategies (RwHTS), in capital projects not only alleviates developmental patterns of humans on water resources but also helps facilities achieve net-zero resource consumption. However, implementation of RwHTS can quickly become complex because of multiple factors associated with the design of the capital facility. Although building information modeling (BIM) possesses inherent capabilities to reduce the complexity of systems, the impact it has on the adoption of RwHTS needs to be assessed. This research characterized implementation patterns for RwHTS and BIM by architectural firms for facilities constructed between 2000 and 2010 in six southeastern states and Washington, DC, using electronic surveys. In addition, the authors analyzed the relationship between the implementation of RwHTS and BIM from architectural firms’ perspectives. Furthermore, the study also identified the relationship between RwHTS/BIM implementation and a firm’s demographics, previous experience with federal projects, and green buildings. Last, the study identified the least and most adopted RwHTS types and BIM functions. Future research needs to investigate into reasons for adopting RwHTS and the process associated with it.","","2016-10-26 14:18:18","2016-10-26 14:18:18","2016-10-26 14:18:18","04016016","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASCE","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\3US8KWK6\Langar and Pearce - Implementation Trends for Rainwater-Harvesting Tec.pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\KQF983UF\(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.html","","G-2014-13593","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This global resurgence is likely linked to increased international travel and commerce in addition to widespread insecticide resistance. Analyses of the C. lectularius sequenced genome (650 Mb) and 14,220 predicted protein-coding genes provide a comprehensive representation of genes that are linked to traumatic insemination, a reduced chemosensory repertoire of genes related to obligate hematophagy, host–symbiont interactions, and several mechanisms of insecticide resistance. In addition, we document the presence of multiple putative lateral gene transfer events. Genome sequencing and annotation establish a solid foundation for future research on mechanisms of insecticide resistance, human–bed bug and symbiont–bed bug associations, and unique features of bed bug biology that contribute to the unprecedented success of C. lectularius as a human ectoparasite.,  The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is a ubiquitous human ectoparasite with global distribution.

We provisioned nymphs from three German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.) populations, which differed in insecticide resistance, with either nutritionally rich or poor (diluted) diet throughout their development. One population was an insecticide-susceptible laboratory strain; the other two populations originated from a field-collected indoxacarb-resistant population, which upon collection was maintained either with or without further selection with indoxacarb. We then measured development time, survival to the adult stage, adult body size, and results of a challenge with indoxacarb. Our results show that indoxacarb resistance and poor nutritional condition increased development time and lowered adult body size, with reinforcing interactions. We also found lower survival to the adult stage in the indoxacarb-selected population, which was exacerbated by poor nutrition. In addition, nutrition imparted a highly significant effect on indoxacarb susceptibility. This study exemplifies how poor nutritional condition can aggravate the life-history costs of resistance and elevate the detrimental effects of insecticide exposure, demonstrating how environmental conditions and resistance may interactively impact individual fitness and insecticide efficacy.","2016-06-27","2016-10-28 17:14:16","2016-10-28 17:14:16","2016-10-28 17:14:16","","","","6","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27345220 PMCID: PMC4922014","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\BQ7MGEFX\Jensen et al. - 2016 - Insecticide resistance and nutrition interactively.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922014/","G-2013-5-35 MBE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the primary host-associated cues known to attract bed bugs - CO2, odors, heat - heat has received little attention as an independent stimulus. We evaluated the effects of target temperatures ranging from 23-48°C on bed bug activation, orientation, and feeding. Activation and orientation responses were assessed using a heated target in a circular arena. All targets heated above ambient temperature activated bed bugs (initiated movement) and elicited oriented movement toward the target, with higher temperatures generally resulting in faster activation and orientation. The distance over which bed bugs could orient toward a heat source was measured using a 2-choice T-maze assay. Positive thermotaxis was limited to distances<3 cm. Bed bug feeding responses on an artificial feeding system increased with feeder temperature up to 38°C and 43°C, and declined precipitously at 48°C. In addition, bed bugs responded to the relative difference between ambient and feeder temperatures. These results highlight the wide range of temperatures which elicit activation, orientation, and feeding responses in bed bugs. In contrast, the ability of bed bugs to correctly orient towards a heated target, independently of other cues, is limited to very short distances (< 3 cm). Finally, bed bug feeding is shown to be relative to ambient temperature, not an absolute response to feeder-blood temperature.","2016-09-29","2016-10-28 17:14:47","2016-10-28 17:14:47","","","","","","","J.

To perform optimally, these formulations must compete favorably with non-toxic alternative foods present within the insect's habitat. We hypothesized that the nutritional history of cockroaches and their acceptance or avoidance of glucose would affect their food preference and thus bait efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment, first providing glucose-accepting and glucose-averse cockroaches nutritionally defined diets and then offering them identical diets containing the insecticide hydramethylnon as a bait proxy to evaluate the effect of diets of differing macronutrient composition on bait performance. RESULTS: The interaction between diet composition and bait composition affected the survival of adult males as well as first-instar nymphs exposed to excretions produced by these males. Survival analyses indicated different responses of glucose-averse and glucose-accepting insects, but generally any combination of diet and bait that resulted in high diet intake and low bait intake reduced secondary kill. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a comprehensive examination of the effect of alternative foods on bait efficacy.

Blattella asahinai is a peridomestic pest and high population densities in residential areas can become a nuisance, especially when adults fly into homes. Few studies to date have been conducted on Asian cockroach control, and we evaluated the efficacy of Zyrox Fly Granular Bait and Maxforce Complete Granular Insect Bait against this species in the laboratory compared with the closely related German cockroach (Blattella germanica (L.)). In no-choice and two-choice assays with both species, Zyrox bait and Maxforce bait achieved nearly 100% mortality within two and five days, respectively. We also tested Zyrox bait against B. asahinai in an invasive field population in North Carolina at the label rate (2 g/m(2)) and at approximately three times the label rate (6.9 g/m(2)), and found that broadcast applications at both rates reduced populations by an average of 64 and 92%, respectively, for 35 d after the initial application. Zyrox Fly Bait appears to be effective against the Asian and German cockroaches, and could be another tool in an integrated pest management program, if its label could be extended or the active ingredient (cyantraniliprole) formulated into a cockroach bait.","2016-08","2016-10-28 17:15:34","2016-10-28 17:15:34","","1807-1812","","4","109","","J.

In the past few decades, the measurement of health-relevant biochemicals such as allergens, endotoxin, and glucan in the context of population health studies has contributed substantially to our understanding of how the built environment can influence health. In the past few years, investigations of the built environment using culture-independent sequence-based analysis have confirmed many previously held expectations about the sources and fates of indoor microbes, and in the process, these methods have also produced several unexpected insights into the indoor microbiome. Perhaps not surprisingly, the biological composition of air and dust appears to be vastly more complex than formerly thought. Over the next decade, molecular metagenomic methods are likely to revolutionize our understanding of the roles of air and dust in the biology of life on earth, and in the process, provide sophisticated new tools to elucidate health-environment interactions.

The populations also show striking disparities in the prevalence of asthma, and little is known about the immune responses underlying these disparities. METHODS: We studied environmental exposures, genetic ancestry, and immune profiles among 60 Amish and Hutterite children, measuring levels of allergens and endotoxins and assessing the microbiome composition of indoor dust samples. Whole blood was collected to measure serum IgE levels, cytokine responses, and gene expression, and peripheral-blood leukocytes were phenotyped with flow cytometry. The effects of dust extracts obtained from Amish and Hutterite homes on immune and airway responses were assessed in a murine model of experimental allergic asthma. RESULTS: Despite the similar genetic ancestries and lifestyles of Amish and Hutterite children, the prevalence of asthma and allergic sensitization was 4 and 6 times as low in the Amish, whereas median endotoxin levels in Amish house dust was 6.8 times as high. Differences in microbial composition were also observed in dust samples from Amish and Hutterite homes. Profound differences in the proportions, phenotypes, and functions of innate immune cells were also found between the two groups of children. In a mouse model of experimental allergic asthma, the intranasal instillation of dust extracts from Amish but not Hutterite homes significantly inhibited airway hyperreactivity and eosinophilia. These protective effects were abrogated in mice that were deficient in MyD88 and Trif, molecules that are critical in innate immune signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our studies in humans and mice indicate that the Amish environment provides protection against asthma by engaging and shaping the innate immune response.

All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. Results An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 μm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as “gold standard.” Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. Conclusions This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.","2015-12-27","2016-11-03 14:46:14","2016-11-03 14:46:14","2016-11-03 14:46:14","","","","3","","Microbiome","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 26715467 PMCID: PMC4696304","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\UE5A29K8\Gordon et al. - 2015 - A simple novel device for air sampling by electrok.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696304/","G-2015-13936","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examined the performance of modified 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for archaea/bacteria and fungi, respectively, with nonaquatic samples. We moved primer bar codes to the 5′ end, allowing for a range of different 3′ primer pairings, such as the 515f/926r primer pair, which amplifies variable regions 4 and 5 of the 16S rRNA gene. We additionally demonstrated that modifications to the 515f/806r (variable region 4) 16S primer pair, which improves detection of Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11 in marine samples, do not degrade performance on taxa already amplified effectively by the original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS primers did result in differential but overall improved performance compared to the original primers. In both cases, the improved primers should be widely adopted for amplicon studies. IMPORTANCE We continue to uncover a wealth of information connecting microbes in important ways to human and environmental ecology. As our scientific knowledge and technical abilities improve, the tools used for microbiome surveys can be modified to improve the accuracy of our techniques, ensuring that we can continue to identify groundbreaking connections between microbes and the ecosystems they populate, from ice caps to the human body. It is important to confirm that modifications to these tools do not cause new, detrimental biases that would inhibit the field rather than continue to move it forward. We therefore demonstrated that two recently modified primer pairs that target taxonomically discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal genomic DNA do not introduce new biases when used on a variety of sample types, from soil to human skin. This confirms the utility of these primers for maintaining currently recommended microbiome research techniques as the state of the art.","2016-02-25","2016-11-03 14:48:53","2016-11-03 14:48:53","2016-11-03 14:48:53","e00009-15","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2015 Walters et al..

Here we use the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) to quantify the degree of sharing of salivary, skin, and fecal microbiota with their environment in captivity. Both species richness and microbial community composition of most surfaces in the Komodo dragon’s environment are similar to the Komodo dragon’s salivary and skin microbiota but less similar to the stool-associated microbiota. We additionally compared host-environment microbiome sharing between captive Komodo dragons and their enclosures, humans and pets and their homes, and wild amphibians and their environments. We observed similar host-environment microbiome sharing patterns among humans and their pets and Komodo dragons, with high levels of human/pet- and Komodo dragon-associated microbes on home and enclosure surfaces. In contrast, only small amounts of amphibian-associated microbes were detected in the animals’ environments. We suggest that the degree of sharing between the Komodo dragon microbiota and its enclosure surfaces has important implications for animal health. These animals evolved in the context of constant exposure to a complex environmental microbiota, which likely shaped their physiological development; in captivity, these animals will not receive significant exposure to microbes not already in their enclosure, with unknown consequences for their health. IMPORTANCE Animals, including humans, have evolved in the context of exposure to a variety of microbial organisms present in the environment. Only recently have humans, and some animals, begun to spend a significant amount of time in enclosed artificial environments, rather than in the more natural spaces in which most of evolution took place. The consequences of this radical change in lifestyle likely extend to the microbes residing in and on our bodies and may have important implications for health and disease. A full characterization of host-microbe sharing in both closed and open environments will provide crucial information that may enable the improvement of health in humans and in captive animals, both of which experience a greater incidence of disease (including chronic illness) than counterparts living under more ecologically natural conditions.","2016-08-30","2016-11-03 14:50:12","2016-11-03 14:50:12","2016-11-03 14:50:12","e00046-16","","4","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2016 Hyde et al..

Here I review recent studies on the microbiology of the built environment, organize their findings into 12 major thematic categories, and comment on how these studies have or have not advanced knowledge in each area beyond what we already knew from over 100 years of applying culture-based methods to building samples. I propose that while we have added tremendous complexity to the rich existing knowledge base, the practical implications of this added complexity remain somewhat elusive. It remains to be seen how this new knowledge base will change how we design, build, and operate buildings. Much more research is needed to better understand the complexity with which indoor microbiomes may affect human health in both positive and negative ways.","2016-08-30","2016-11-03 14:50:43","2017-08-14 22:29:54","2016-11-03 14:50:43","e00083-16","","4","1","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2016 Stephens..

This citizen-researcher relationship creates an incredible synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects that would otherwise prove impossible in traditional research settings, namely due to the scope of needed human or financial resources (or both). However, citizen-science projects are not without their challenges. For instance, as projects are scaled up, there is concern regarding the rigor and usability of data collected by citizens who are not formally trained in research science. While these concerns are legitimate, we have seen examples of highly successful citizen-science projects from multiple scientific disciplines that have enhanced our collective understanding of science, such as how RNA molecules fold or determining the microbial metagenomic snapshot of an entire public transportation system. These and other emerging citizen-science projects show how improved protocols for reliable, large-scale science can realize both an improvement of scientific understanding for the general public and novel views of the world around us.","2016-03-01","2016-11-03 14:58:08","2016-11-03 14:58:08","2016-11-03 14:58:08","7-12","","1","17","","J Microbiol Biol Educ","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27047581 PMCID: PMC4798819","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\WZNF2QQ2\Garbarino and Mason - 2016 - The Power of Engaging Citizen Scientists for Scien.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4798819/","G-2015-13964","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although DNA sequencing technologies have enabled a new view of the ubiquity and diversity of microorganisms, this has mainly yielded snapshots that shed limited light on microbial functions or community dynamics. Given that nearly every habitat and organism hosts a diverse constellation of microorganisms—its “microbiome”—such knowledge could transform our understanding of the world and launch innovations in agriculture, energy, health, the environment, and more (see the photo). We propose an interdisciplinary Unified Microbiome Initiative (UMI) to discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems. The impacts of oceans and soil microbes on atmospheric CO2 are critical for understanding climate change (2). By manipulating interactions at the root-soil-microbe interface, we may reduce agricultural pesticide, fertilizer, and water use enrich marginal land and rehabilitate degraded soils. Microbes can degrade plant cell walls (for biofuels), and synthesize myriad small molecules for new bioproducts, including antibiotics (3). Restoring normal human microbial ecosystems can save lives [e.g., fecal microbiome transplantation for Clostridium difficile infections (4)]. Rational management of microbial communities in and around us has implications for asthma, diabetes, obesity, infectious diseases, psychiatric illnesses, and other afflictions (5, 6). The human microbiome is a target and a source for new drugs (7) and an essential tool for precision medicine (8).

We investigated the composition and diversity of fungal communities over the Amazon rainforest canopy and compared these communities to fungal communities found in terrestrial environments. We characterized the total fungal community and the metabolically active portion of the community using high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing and compared these data to predictions generated by a mass-balance model. We found that the total community was primarily comprised of fungi from the phylum Basidiomycota. In contrast, the active community was primarily composed of members of the phylum Ascomycota and included a high relative abundance of lichen fungi, which were not detected in the total community. The relative abundance of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota in the total and active communities was consistent with our model predictions, suggesting that this result was driven by the relative size and number of spores produced by these groups. When compared to other environments, fungal communities in the atmosphere were most similar to communities found in tropical soils and leaf surfaces. Our results demonstrate that there are significant differences in the composition of the total and active fungal communities in the atmosphere, and that lichen fungi, which have been shown to be efficient ice nucleators, may be abundant members of active atmospheric fungal communities over the forest canopy.","2015-11-06","2016-11-03 15:56:05","2016-11-03 15:56:05","2016-11-03 15:56:05","6337-6349","","21","12","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copernicus Online Journals","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\C5XSWNKN\Womack et al. - 2015 - Characterization of active and total fungal commun.pdf","","G-2015-14023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodological limitations have led to gaps in our understanding of the habitat range and subpopulation complexity of founding strains, as well as how different body sites support microbial growth. Here, we used metagenomics to reconstruct genomes of strains that colonized the skin, mouth and gut of two hospitalized premature infants during the first month of life. Seven bacterial populations, considered to be identical given whole-genome average nucleotide identity of >99.9%, colonized multiple body sites, yet none were shared between infants. Gut-associated Citrobacter koseri genomes harbored 47 polymorphic sites that we used to define 10 sub-populations, one of which appeared in the gut after one week but did not spread to other body sites. Differential genome coverage was used to measure bacterial population replication rates in situ. In all cases where the same bacterial population was detected in multiple body sites replication rates were faster in mouth and skin compared to the gut. The ability of identical strains to colonize multiple body sites underscores the habit flexibility of initial colonists whereas differences in microbial replication rates between body sites suggest differences in host control and/or resource availability. Population genomic analyses revealed microdiversity within bacterial populations, implying initial inoculation by multiple individual cells with distinct genotypes. Overall, however, the overlap of strains across body sites implies that the premature infant microbiome can exhibit very low microbial diversity.","2017-01-10","2017-04-24 19:57:03","2018-03-15 16:50:55","2017-04-24 19:57:03","gr.213256.116","","","","","Genome Res.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","genome.cshlp.org","","PMID: 28073918","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\53F82JUF\Olm et al. - 2017 - Identical bacterial populations colonize premature.pdf; ; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\8UUKAWHN\gr.213256.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28073918","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"656WDRPE","journalArticle","1975","Bennun, A.","Hypothesis on the role of liganded states of proteins in energy transducing systems","Bio Systems","","0303-2647","","","In energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another. Catalysis by those systems implies, therefore, that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves, with activatory and/or inhibitory ligands (H+, H2O, metals, etc.) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules. The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems. Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems. This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins. Similarly, the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxido-reduction of electron carriers to induced-fit effects leading to a sequence of ATPase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy transducing organelles.","1975-10","2017-05-04 19:24:00","2017-05-04 19:24:00","","230-244","","2","7","","BioSystems","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 1121","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1121","","Kinetics; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Animals; Adenine Nucleotides; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Binding Sites; Electron Transport; Energy Transfer; Hemoglobins; Ligands; Metals; Models, Biological; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen; Phosphates; Protein Binding; Proteins; Thermodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature. No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1). Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found. Under the conditions applied, the N-nitrosoacylarylamine rapidly rearranges by 1,3-migration of the acetyl group. The resulting diazoester dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt. Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation. The yields obtained in dilute aqueous nitrosation mixtures are lower than expected; the reasons for this finding are discussed. Preliminary results of animal experiments show that the N-nitroso compound is a directly acting carcinogen.","1975-10","2017-05-04 19:24:16","2017-05-04 19:24:16","","1472-1475","","10","25","","Arzneimittelforschung","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 1040","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1040","","Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Temperature; Mass spectrometry; Acetanilides; Carcinogens; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Drug Stability; Methods; Nitrogen Oxides; Nitroso Compounds; Nitrous Acid; Phenacetin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.","1976-02-01","2017-05-04 19:29:06","2017-05-04 19:29:06","","263-267","","3","124","","Am.

One hybrid species was prepared by dissociation and reconstitution of a mixture of two variants produced by chemical modification of the native enzyme with succinic anhydride and tetranitromethane, respectively. The succinyl-nitrotyrosyl hybrid was separated from the other members of the hybrid set by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and then converted to a succinyl-aminotyrosyl hybrid by reduction of the modified tyrosine residues with sodium dithionite. A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit.","1975-12-15","2017-05-04 19:29:08","2017-05-04 19:29:08","","262-272","","2","412","","Biochim.

Since then, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) have been observed in ambient particulate matter, and have been generated in particulate matter generated from internal combustion engines. For the first time, we measure in situ the formation and decay of EPFRs through the heterogeneous reaction of ozone and several polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC). Solid anthracene (ANT), pyrene (PY), benzo[a]pyrene (BAP), benzo[ghi]perylene (BGHIP), 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4NQ), and 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ) were reacted with gas-phase ozone in a flow system placed in the active cavity of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer, and the formation of radicals was measured on the timescale of tens of minutes at ambient levels of ozone down to 30 ppb. For most substrates the net radical production is initially rapid, slows at intermediate times, and is followed by a slow decay. For oxidized solid BAP, radical signal persists for many days in the absence of ozone. To evaluate the effect of substrate phase, the solid PAHs were also dissolved in squalane, an organic oil inert to ozone, which yielded a much higher maximum radical concentration and faster radical decay when exposed to ozone. With higher mobility, reactants were apparently able to more easily diffuse and react with each other, yielding the higher radical concentrations. The EPR spectra exhibit three radicals types, two of which have been assigned to semiquinone species and one to a PAH-derived, carbon-centered radical. Although our system uses levels of PAC not typically found in the environment it is worth noting that the amounts of radical formed, on the order of 1018 radicals per g, are comparable to those observed in ambient particulate matter.","2015-12-17","2017-06-06 20:15:53","2017-06-06 20:15:53","2017-06-06 20:15:53","205-212","","1","18","","Phys.

A","","1873-3778","10.1016/j.chroma.2016.03.009","","Monolithic silica materials (first unclad monolith rods, then monolithic capillary columns) were prepared using various amounts of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) with different molecular weight (MW). The monolith rods were used to examine the mesoporosity by argon physisorption technique, and the macroporosity by mercury intrusion porosimetry. Subsequently, silica-based monolithic capillary columns with an inner diameter of 100μm were produced using the same preparation conditions as used for the rods. The results obtained with the monolith rods showed the following important findings: (1) it is feasible to fabricate monolithic silica rods possessing macropore size of 0.5-1.4μm by tuning the amount of PEGs (independently of the MW), whereas the macropore volume and the mesoporosity remain similar. (2) the smallest macropore size (0.5μm) rod prepared with PEG having a MW=20,000g/mol provided a narrower macropore size distribution than with PEG with MW=10,000g/mol. The monolithic capillary columns produced with the different PEG type showed similar retention factors for hexylbenzene (k=2.3-2.4) and similar t0-based column permeability (Kv0=2.3-2.4×10(-14)m(2)) in 20:80% (v/v) water:methanol, as expected from the results obtained with the monolith rods. The column prepared with PEG of MW=20,000g/mol gave a plate height of H=4.0μm for hexylbenzene at an optimal linear velocity of u0=2.6mm/s in 20:80% (v/v) water containing 0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest plate height ever recorded for a monolithic column. Comparing the kinetic performance at 30MPa shows that the best monolithic silica column obtained in the present study performs better than the second-generation monolithic silica columns developed up till now in the practically most relevant range of plate numbers (N≤40,000). In this range, the performance is now similar to that of 2.7μm core-shell particle columns.","2016-03-07","2017-06-06 20:08:28","2017-06-06 20:08:28","","","","","","","J Chromatogr A","","","","","","","","ENG","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26976349","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26976349","","Capillary column; Column efficiency; Kinetic performance; Silica monolith; Small domain size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease, hygiene has become increasingly conflated with that of sterilization. Recent research on microbial ecology is demonstrating that humans have intimate and evolutionarily significant relationships with a diverse assemblage of microorganisms (our microbiota). Human skin is home to a diverse, skin-habitat specific community of microorganisms; this includes members that exist across the ecological spectrum from pathogen through commensal to mutualist. Most evidence suggests that the skin microbiota is likely of direct benefit to the host, and only rarely exhibits pathogenicity. This complex ecological context suggests that the conception of hygiene as a unilateral reduction or removal of microbes has outlived its usefulness. As such, we suggest the explicit definition of hygiene as 'those actions and practices that reduce the spread or transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, and thus reduce the incidence of disease'. To examine the implications of this definition, we review the literature related to hand drying as an aspect of hand hygienic practice. Research on hand drying generally focuses on 'hygienic efficacy', a concept not typically defined explicitly, but nearly always including alterations to bulk microbial load. The corresponding literature is differentiable into two divisions: research supporting the use of forced air dryers, which typically includes effectiveness of drying as an aspect of hygienic efficacy; and research supporting the use of paper towels, which typically includes risk of aerosolized spread of microbes from hands as an aspect of hygienic efficacy. Utilizing a definition of hygiene that explicitly relies on reduction in disease spread rather than alterations to bulk microbial load would address concerns raised on both sides of the debate. Future research should take advantage of cultivation-independent techniques, working to bridge the gap between the two existing divisions of research by using health outcomes (such as the spread of disease) as dependent variables, taking into account the microbial community context of the skin microbiota, and focusing on understanding the relative contribution of bioaerosols and residual moisture to the risk of disease transmission.","2016-12-20","2017-06-07 03:52:00","2017-06-07 03:52:00","2017-06-07 03:52:00","","","","","","","Cleanliness in context","","","","","","","","","","","","DataCite","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Members of the new phylum Cryptomycota were proposed to represent intermediate fungal forms, lacking a chitinous cell wall during feeding and known almost exclusively from ubiquitous environmental ribosomal RNA sequences that cluster at the base of the fungal tree [1, 2]. Here, we sequence the first Cryptomycotan genome (the water mold endoparasite Rozella allomycis) and unite the Cryptomycota with another group of endoparasites, the microsporidia, based on phylogenomics and shared genomic traits. We propose that Cryptomycota and microsporidia share a common endoparasitic ancestor, with the clade unified by a chitinous cell wall used to develop turgor pressure in the infection process [3, 4]. Shared genomic elements include a nucleotide transporter that is used by microsporidia for stealing energy in the form of ATP from their hosts [5]. Rozella harbors a mitochondrion that contains a very rapidly evolving genome and lacks complex I of the respiratory chain. These degenerate features are offset by the presence of nuclear genes for alternative respiratory pathways. The Rozella proteome has not undergone major contraction like microsporidia; instead, several classes have undergone expansion, such as host-effector, signal-transduction, and folding proteins.","2013-08-19","2017-06-12 17:22:28","2017-06-12 17:22:28","","1548-1553","","16","23","","Curr.

Biological Sciences","","1471-2954","10.1098/rspb.2013.2146","","Mutualistic bacteria infect most eukaryotic species in nearly every biome. Nonetheless, two dilemmas remain unresolved about bacterial-eukaryote mutualisms: how do mutualist phenotypes originate in bacterial lineages and to what degree do mutualists traits drive or hinder bacterial diversification? Here, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the hyperdiverse phylum Proteobacteria to investigate the origins and evolutionary diversification of mutualistic bacterial phenotypes. Our ancestral state reconstructions (ASRs) inferred a range of 34-39 independent origins of mutualist phenotypes in Proteobacteria, revealing the surprising frequency with which host-beneficial traits have evolved in this phylum. We found proteobacterial mutualists to be more often derived from parasitic than from free-living ancestors, consistent with the untested paradigm that bacterial mutualists most often evolve from pathogens. Strikingly, we inferred that mutualists exhibit a negative net diversification rate (speciation minus extinction), which suggests that mutualism evolves primarily via transitions from other states rather than diversification within mutualist taxa. Moreover, our ASRs infer that proteobacterial mutualist lineages exhibit a paucity of reversals to parasitism or to free-living status. This evolutionary conservatism of mutualism is contrary to long-standing theory, which predicts that selection should often favour mutants in microbial mutualist populations that exploit or abandon more slowly evolving eukaryotic hosts.","2014-01-22","2017-06-12 17:23:10","2017-06-12 17:23:10","","20132146","","1775","281","","Proc.

Mucoromycotina represent early diverging models that are most valuable for understanding fungal evolution. Here we reveal the uniqueness of the cell wall structure of the Mucoromycotina Rhizopus oryzae and Phycomyces blakesleeanus compared with the better characterized cell wall of the ascomycete Neurospora crassa. We have analysed the corresponding polysaccharide biosynthetic and modifying pathways, and highlight their evolutionary features and higher complexity in terms of gene copy numbers compared with species from other lineages. This work uncovers the presence in Mucoromycotina of abundant fucose-based polysaccharides similar to algal fucoidans. These unexpected polymers are associated with unusually low amounts of glucans and a higher proportion of chitin compared with N. crassa. The specific structural features are supported by the identification of genes potentially involved in the corresponding metabolic pathways. Phylogenomic analyses of genes encoding carbohydrate synthases, polysaccharide modifying enzymes and enzymes involved in nucleotide-sugar formation provide evidence for duplication events during evolution of cell wall metabolism in fungi. Altogether, the data highlight the specificity of Mucoromycotina cell walls and pave the way for a finer understanding of their metabolism.","2015-05","2017-06-12 17:23:37","2017-06-12 17:23:37","","1649-1662","","5","17","","Environ.

Genes involved in the virulence of the meningitis-causing fungus are being characterized at an increasing rate, and to date, at least 648 Cryptococcus gene names have been published. However, these data are scattered throughout the literature and are challenging to find. Furthermore, conflicts in locus identification exist, so that named genes have been subsequently published under new names or names associated with one locus have been used for another locus. To avoid these conflicts and to provide a central source of Cryptococcus gene information, we have collected all published Cryptococcus gene names from the scientific literature and associated them with standard Cryptococcus locus identifiers and have incorporated them into FungiDB (www.fungidb.org). FungiDB is a panfungal genome database that collects gene information and functional data and provides search tools for 61 species of fungi and oomycetes. We applied these published names to a manually curated ortholog set of all Cryptococcus species currently in FungiDB, including Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans strains JEC21 and B-3501A, C. neoformans var. grubii strain H99, and Cryptococcus gattii strains R265 and WM276, and have written brief descriptions of their functions.

The centralization of genomic and literature-based information for Cryptococcus at FungiDB will help researchers communicate about genes of interest, such as those related to virulence, and will further facilitate research on the pathogen.","2014-07","2017-06-12 17:23:52","2017-06-12 17:23:52","","878-883","","7","13","","Eukaryotic Cell","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24813190 PMCID: PMC4135733","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24813190","","Cryptococcus; Genes, Fungal; Terminology as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous analysis of the Bd genome revealed a unique expansion of the carbohydrate-binding module family 18 (CBM18) predicted to be a sub-class of chitin recognition domains. CBM expansions have been linked to the evolution of pathogenicity in a variety of fungal species by protecting the fungus from the host. Based on phylogenetic analysis and presence of additional protein domains, the gene family can be classified into 3 classes: Tyrosinase-, Deacetylase-, and Lectin-like. Examination of the mRNA expression levels from sporangia and zoospores of nine of the cbm18 genes found that the Lectin-like genes had the highest expression while the Tyrosinase-like genes showed little expression, especially in zoospores. Heterologous expression of GFP-tagged copies of four CBM18 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that two copies containing secretion signal peptides are trafficked to the cell boundary. The Lectin-like genes cbm18-ll1 and cbm18-ll2 co-localized with the chitinous cell boundaries visualized by staining with calcofluor white. In vitro assays of the full length and single domain copies from CBM18-LL1 demonstrated chitin binding and no binding to cellulose or xylan. Expressed CBM18 domain proteins were demonstrated to protect the fungus, Trichoderma reeseii, in vitro against hydrolysis from exogenously added chitinase, likely by binding and limiting exposure of fungal chitin. These results demonstrate that cbm18 genes can play a role in fungal defense and expansion of their copy number may be an important pathogenicity factor of this emerging infectious disease of amphibians.","2015-04","2017-06-12 17:24:05","2017-06-12 17:24:05","","31-39","","","77","","Fungal Genet.

In the fungal Ascomycota, CM is based on hyphal filaments and arose in the Pezizomycotina. The genus Neolecta defines an enigma: phylogenetically placed in a related group containing mostly yeasts, Neolecta nevertheless possesses Pezizomycotina-like CM. Here we sequence the Neolecta irregularis genome and identify CM-associated functions by searching for genes conserved in Neolecta and the Pezizomycotina, which are absent or divergent in budding or fission yeasts. This group of 1,050 genes is enriched for functions related to diverse endomembrane systems and their organization. Remarkably, most show evidence for divergence in both yeasts. Using functional genomics, we identify new genes involved in fungal complexification. Together, these data show that rudimentary multicellularity is deeply rooted in the Ascomycota. Extensive parallel gene divergence during simplification and constraint leading to CM suggest a deterministic process where shared modes of cellular organization select for similarly configured organelle- and transport-related machineries.","2017-02-08","2017-06-12 17:24:22","2017-06-12 17:24:22","","14444","","","8","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28176784 PMCID: PMC5309816","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28176784","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further experimental and bioinformatic analyses of other mitochondrial plasmids, random sequences, and natural nuclear genes in Neurospora and other fungi indicate that fungal spliceosomes recognize a wide range of 5' splice site and branchpoint sequences and predict introns to be present at high frequency in random sequence. In contrast, analysis of intronless fungal nuclear genes indicates that branchpoint, 5' splice site and 3' splice site consensus sequences are underrepresented compared with random sequences. This underrepresentation of splicing signals is sufficient to deplete the nuclear genome of splice sites at locations that do not comprise biologically relevant introns. Thus, the splicing machinery can recognize a wide range of splicing signal sequences, but splicing still occurs with great accuracy, not because the splicing machinery distinguishes correct from incorrect introns, but because incorrect introns are substantially depleted from the genome.","2015-05","2017-06-12 17:24:37","2017-06-12 17:24:37","","997-1004","","5","21","","RNA","The low information content of Neurospora splicing signals","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25805857 PMCID: PMC4408805","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25805857","","Plasmids; Base Sequence; Species Specificity; Mitochondria; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Speciation; Introns; Neurospora; RNA Splice Sites; RNA Splicing; Spliceosomes; mitochondrial plasmids; splicing specificity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Opsins can be classified into two types and share little sequence identity: type 1, typically found in bacteria, and type 2, primarily characterized in metazoa. The type 2 opsins (Rhodopsins) are a subfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), a large and diverse class of seven transmembrane proteins and are generally restricted to metazoan lineages. Fungi use light receptors including opsins to sense the environment and transduce signals for developmental or metabolic changes. Opsins characterized in the Dikarya (Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes) are of the type 1 bacteriorhodopsin family but the early diverging fungal lineages have not been as well surveyed. We identified by sequence similarity a rhodopsin-like GPCR in genomes of early diverging chytrids and examined the structural characteristics of this protein to assess its likelihood to be homologous to animal rhodopsins and bind similar chromophores. METHODS: We used template-based structure modeling, automated ligand docking, and molecular modeling to assess the structural and binding properties of an identified opsin-like protein found in Spizellomyces punctatus, a unicellular, flagellated species belonging to Chytridiomycota, one of the earliest diverging fungal lineages. We tested if the sequence and inferred structure were consistent with a solved crystal structure of a type 2 rhodopsin from the squid Todarodes pacificus. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the Spizellomyces opsin has structural characteristics consistent with functional animal type 2 rhodopsins and is capable of maintaining a stable structure when associated with the retinaldehyde chromophore, specifically the 9-cis-retinal isomer. Together, these results support further the homology of Spizellomyces opsins to animal type 2 rhodopsins. DISCUSSION: This represents the first test of structure/function relationship of a type 2 rhodopsin identified in early branching fungal lineages, and provides a foundation for future work exploring pathways and components of photoreception in early fungi.","2017","2017-06-12 17:24:51","2017-06-12 17:24:51","","e3206","","","5","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28462022 PMCID: PMC5410147","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28462022","","evolution; Mycology; Chytrid; Early diverging fungi; GPCR; Homology modeling; Light receptor; Opsin; Protein structure; Zoosporic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gregory","cual-id: Globally Unique, Correctable, and Human-Friendly Sample Identifiers for Comparative Omics Studies","mSystems","","2379-5077","10.1128/mSystems.00010-15","","The number of samples in high-throughput comparative ""omics"" studies is increasing rapidly due to declining experimental costs. To keep sample data and metadata manageable and to ensure the integrity of scientific results as the scale of these projects continues to increase, it is essential that we transition to better-designed sample identifiers. Ideally, sample identifiers should be globally unique across projects, project teams, and institutions; short (to facilitate manual transcription); correctable with respect to common types of transcription errors; opaque, meaning that they do not contain information about the samples; and compatible with existing standards. We present cual-id, a lightweight command line tool that creates, or mints, sample identifiers that meet these criteria without reliance on centralized infrastructure. cual-id allows users to assign universally unique identifiers, or UUIDs, that are globally unique to their samples. UUIDs are too long to be conveniently written on sampling materials, such as swabs or microcentrifuge tubes, however, so cual-id additionally generates human-friendly 4- to 12-character identifiers that map to their UUIDs and are unique within a project. By convention, we use ""cual-id"" to refer to the software, ""CualID"" to refer to the short, human-friendly identifiers, and ""UUID"" to refer to the globally unique identifiers. CualIDs are used by humans when they manually write or enter identifiers, while the longer UUIDs are used by computers to unambiguously reference a sample. Finally, cual-id optionally generates printable label sticker sheets containing Code 128 bar codes and CualIDs for labeling of sample collection and processing materials. IMPORTANCE The adoption of identifiers that are globally unique, correctable, and easily handwritten or manually entered into a computer will be a major step forward for sample tracking in comparative omics studies. As the fields transition to more-centralized sample management, for example, across labs within an institution, across projects funded under a common program, or in systems designed to facilitate meta- and/or integrated analysis, sample identifiers generated with cual-id will not need to change; thus, costly and error-prone updating of data and metadata identifiers will be avoided. Further, using cual-id will ensure that transcription errors in sample identifiers do not require the discarding of otherwise-useful samples that may have been expensive to obtain. Finally, cual-id is simple to install and use and is free for all use. No centralized infrastructure is required to ensure global uniqueness, so it is feasible for any lab to get started using these identifiers within their existing infrastructure.","2016-02","2017-07-11 03:48:55","2017-07-11 03:48:55","","","","1","1","","mSystems","cual-id","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27822516 PMCID: PMC5069752","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822516","","bioinformatics; microbiome; genomes; metabolome; metagenome; transcriptome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gregory","Keemei: cloud-based validation of tabular bioinformatics file formats in Google Sheets","GigaScience","","2047-217X","10.1186/s13742-016-0133-6","","BACKGROUND: Bioinformatics software often requires human-generated tabular text files as input and has specific requirements for how those data are formatted. Users frequently manage these data in spreadsheet programs, which is convenient for researchers who are compiling the requisite information because the spreadsheet programs can easily be used on different platforms including laptops and tablets, and because they provide a familiar interface. It is increasingly common for many different researchers to be involved in compiling these data, including study coordinators, clinicians, lab technicians and bioinformaticians. As a result, many research groups are shifting toward using cloud-based spreadsheet programs, such as Google Sheets, which support the concurrent editing of a single spreadsheet by different users working on different platforms. Most of the researchers who enter data are not familiar with the formatting requirements of the bioinformatics programs that will be used, so validating and correcting file formats is often a bottleneck prior to beginning bioinformatics analysis. MAIN TEXT: We present Keemei, a Google Sheets Add-on, for validating tabular files used in bioinformatics analyses. Keemei is available free of charge from Google's Chrome Web Store. Keemei can be installed and run on any web browser supported by Google Sheets. Keemei currently supports the validation of two widely used tabular bioinformatics formats, the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) sample metadata mapping file format and the Spatially Referenced Genetic Data (SRGD) format, but is designed to easily support the addition of others. CONCLUSIONS: Keemei will save researchers time and frustration by providing a convenient interface for tabular bioinformatics file format validation. By allowing everyone involved with data entry for a project to easily validate their data, it will reduce the validation and formatting bottlenecks that are commonly encountered when human-generated data files are first used with a bioinformatics system. Simplifying the validation of essential tabular data files, such as sample metadata, will reduce common errors and thereby improve the quality and reliability of research outcomes.","2016-06-13","2017-07-11 03:48:57","2017-07-11 03:48:57","","27","","","5","","Gigascience","Keemei","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27296526 PMCID: PMC4906574","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27296526","","Cloud; Data validation; Metadata; Plugin; QIIME; Spreadsheet; Tabular file format","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to design internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and an Illumina protocol that would maximize coverage of the kingdom Fungi while minimizing nontarget eukaryotes. We inspected alignments of the 5.8S and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal genes and evaluated potential primers using PrimerProspector. We tested the resulting primers using tiered-abundance mock communities and five previously characterized soil samples. We recovered operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to all 8 members in both mock communities, despite DNA abundances spanning 3 orders of magnitude. The expected and observed read counts were strongly correlated (r = 0.94 to 0.97). However, several taxa were consistently over- or underrepresented, likely due to variation in rRNA gene copy numbers. The Illumina data resulted in clustering of soil samples identical to that obtained with Sanger sequence clone library data using different primers. Furthermore, the two methods produced distance matrices with a Mantel correlation of 0.92. Nonfungal sequences comprised less than 0.5% of the soil data set, with most attributable to vascular plants. Our results suggest that high-throughput methods can produce fairly accurate estimates of fungal abundances in complex communities. Further improvements might be achieved through corrections for rRNA copy number and utilization of standardized mock communities. IMPORTANCE: Fungi play numerous important roles in the environment. Improvements in sequencing methods are providing revolutionary insights into fungal biodiversity, yet accurate estimates of the number of fungal species (i.e., richness) and their relative abundances in an environmental sample (e.g., soil, roots, water, etc.) remain difficult to obtain. We present improved methods for high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the species-diagnostic fungal ribosomal marker gene that improve the accuracy of richness and abundance estimates. The improvements include new PCR primers and library preparation, validation using a known mock community, and bioinformatic parameter tuning.","2016-12-15","2017-07-11 03:48:59","2017-07-11 03:48:59","","7217-7226","","24","82","","Appl.

Reproducibility in microbial ecology research depends on the reliability of OTU-based 16S ribosomal subunit RNA (rRNA) analyses. RESULTS: Here, we report that many hierarchical and greedy clustering methods produce unstable OTUs, with membership that depends on the number of sequences clustered. If OTUs are regenerated with additional sequences or samples, sequences originally assigned to a given OTU can be split into different OTUs. Alternatively, sequences assigned to different OTUs can be merged into a single OTU. This OTU instability affects alpha-diversity analyses such as rarefaction curves, beta-diversity analyses such as distance-based ordination (for example, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)), and the identification of differentially represented OTUs. Our results show that the proportion of unstable OTUs varies for different clustering methods. We found that the closed-reference method is the only one that produces completely stable OTUs, with the caveat that sequences that do not match a pre-existing reference sequence collection are discarded. CONCLUSIONS: As a compromise to the factors listed above, we propose using an open-reference method to enhance OTU stability. This type of method clusters sequences against a database and includes unmatched sequences by clustering them via a relatively stable de novo clustering method. OTU stability is an important consideration when analyzing microbial diversity and is a feature that should be taken into account during the development of novel OTU clustering methods.","2015","2017-07-11 03:49:01","2017-07-11 03:49:01","","20","","","3","","Microbiome","Stability of operational taxonomic units","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25995836 PMCID: PMC4438525","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25995836","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gregory","Subsampled open-reference clustering creates consistent, comprehensive OTU definitions and scales to billions of sequences","PeerJ","","2167-8359","10.7717/peerj.545","","We present a performance-optimized algorithm, subsampled open-reference OTU picking, for assigning marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) sequences generated on next-generation sequencing platforms to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for microbial community analysis. This algorithm provides benefits over de novo OTU picking (clustering can be performed largely in parallel, reducing runtime) and closed-reference OTU picking (all reads are clustered, not only those that match a reference database sequence with high similarity). Because more of our algorithm can be run in parallel relative to ""classic"" open-reference OTU picking, it makes open-reference OTU picking tractable on massive amplicon sequence data sets (though on smaller data sets, ""classic"" open-reference OTU clustering is often faster). We illustrate that here by applying it to the first 15,000 samples sequenced for the Earth Microbiome Project (1.3 billion V4 16S rRNA amplicons). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest OTU picking run ever performed, and we estimate that our new algorithm runs in less than 1/5 the time than would be required of ""classic"" open reference OTU picking. We show that subsampled open-reference OTU picking yields results that are highly correlated with those generated by ""classic"" open-reference OTU picking through comparisons on three well-studied datasets. An implementation of this algorithm is provided in the popular QIIME software package, which uses uclust for read clustering. All analyses were performed using QIIME's uclust wrappers, though we provide details (aided by the open-source code in our GitHub repository) that will allow implementation of subsampled open-reference OTU picking independently of QIIME (e.g., in a compiled programming language, where runtimes should be further reduced). Our analyses should generalize to other implementations of these OTU picking algorithms. Finally, we present a comparison of parameter settings in QIIME's OTU picking workflows and make recommendations on settings for these free parameters to optimize runtime without reducing the quality of the results. These optimized parameters can vastly decrease the runtime of uclust-based OTU picking in QIIME.","2014","2017-07-11 03:49:03","2017-07-11 03:49:03","","e545","","","2","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25177538 PMCID: PMC4145071","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177538","","bioinformatics; microbial ecology; microbiome; QIIME; OTU picking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gregory; Knight, Rob","Open-Source Sequence Clustering Methods Improve the State Of the Art","mSystems","","2379-5077","10.1128/mSystems.00003-15","","Sequence clustering is a common early step in amplicon-based microbial community analysis, when raw sequencing reads are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to reduce the run time of subsequent analysis steps. Here, we evaluated the performance of recently released state-of-the-art open-source clustering software products, namely, OTUCLUST, Swarm, SUMACLUST, and SortMeRNA, against current principal options (UCLUST and USEARCH) in QIIME, hierarchical clustering methods in mothur, and USEARCH's most recent clustering algorithm, UPARSE. All the latest open-source tools showed promising results, reporting up to 60% fewer spurious OTUs than UCLUST, indicating that the underlying clustering algorithm can vastly reduce the number of these derived OTUs. Furthermore, we observed that stringent quality filtering, such as is done in UPARSE, can cause a significant underestimation of species abundance and diversity, leading to incorrect biological results. Swarm, SUMACLUST, and SortMeRNA have been included in the QIIME 1.9.0 release. IMPORTANCE Massive collections of next-generation sequencing data call for fast, accurate, and easily accessible bioinformatics algorithms to perform sequence clustering. A comprehensive benchmark is presented, including open-source tools and the popular USEARCH suite. Simulated, mock, and environmental communities were used to analyze sensitivity, selectivity, species diversity (alpha and beta), and taxonomic composition. The results demonstrate that recent clustering algorithms can significantly improve accuracy and preserve estimated diversity without the application of aggressive filtering. Moreover, these tools are all open source, apply multiple levels of multithreading, and scale to the demands of modern next-generation sequencing data, which is essential for the analysis of massive multidisciplinary studies such as the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) (J.

Exposure assessment can be improved through enhanced understanding of source-receptor relationships, for example as expressed in the inhalation intake fraction metric. This study provides new knowledge about how inhalation intake of airborne particles varies with spatially varying indoor emissions. In a controlled environmental chamber with low background particle levels, we monitored the time- and size-resolved particle concentrations at multiple locations including the subject's breathing zone. We investigated two types of particle emissions: (i) controlled releases from several specific indoor locations; and (ii) natural release from skin and clothing for a range of simulated occupant activities. Findings show that particles released proximate to the human envelope caused a total inhalation intake fraction of 7–10 per thousand, which was 1.5–16 × higher than the intake fraction for other indoor release locations. These outcomes reflect the influence of emissions-receptor proximity combined with the efficient transport of particles by means of the thermal plume to the breathing zone. The results show that the well-mixed representation of an indoor environment could underestimate the inhalation intake by 40–90% for various localized indoor emissions, and by up to 3 × for particles emitted from the human envelope. The post-release exposure period contributed substantially to total inhalation intake. For particles released naturally from the human envelope, inhalation intake fractions varied with activity type and were higher for a subject when seated rather than walking.","2017-10-01","2017-07-19 18:44:48","2017-07-19 18:44:48","2017-07-19 18:44:48","14-22","","","123","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\4PTES9KU\Licina etal BAE 2017 (002) Nazaroff.pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\K8HBBMW3\S036013231730272X.html","","","Human activity; Exposure duration; Indoor particles; Inhalation intake; Source location; Thermal plume","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we employed a combined culture-independent (454-pyrosequencing) and culture-dependent (dilution-to-extinction) approach to investigate the mycobiota of indoor dust collected from 93 buildings in 12 countries worldwide. High and low water activity (aw) media were used to capture mesophile and xerophile biodiversity, resulting in the isolation of approximately 9 000 strains. Among these, 340 strains representing seven putative species in Aspergillus subgenus Polypaecilum were isolated, mostly from lowered aw media, and tentatively identified based on colony morphology and internal transcribed spacer rDNA region (ITS) barcodes. Further morphological study and phylogenetic analyses using sequences of ITS, β-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin (CaM), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), and a pre-mRNA processing protein homolog (TSR1) confirmed the isolation of seven species of subgenus Polypaecilum, including five novel species: A. baarnensis, A. keratitidis, A. kalimae sp. nov., A. noonimiae sp. nov., A. thailandensis sp. nov., A. waynelawii sp. nov., and A. whitfieldii sp. nov. Pyrosequencing detected six of the seven species isolated from house dust, as well as one additional species absent from the cultures isolated, and three clades representing potentially undescribed species. Species were typically found in house dust from subtropical and tropical climates, often in close proximity to the ocean or sea. The presence of subgenus Polypaecilum, a recently described clade of xerophilic/xerotolerant, halotolerant/halophilic, and potentially zoopathogenic species, within the built environment is noteworthy.","2017-09-01","2018-02-01 21:53:38","2018-02-01 21:53:38","2018-02-01 21:53:38","237-267","","","88","","Studies in Mycology","","Diversity and taxonomy of Food and Indoor Fungi","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\TWNB7BFQ\Tanney et al. - 2017 - Aspergillus subgenus Polypaecilum from the built e.pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\J575V2PN\S0166061617300477.html","","","Canine pathogens; Halophile; Xerophile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, a polyphasic approach using morphological characters, extrolites, physiological characters and phylogeny was applied to investigate the taxonomy of this section. Over 500 strains from various culture collections and new isolates obtained from indoor environments and a wide range of substrates all over the world were identified using calmodulin gene sequencing. Of these, 163 isolates were subjected to molecular phylogenetic analyses using sequences of ITS rDNA, partial β-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin (CaM) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) genes. Colony characteristics were documented on eight cultivation media, growth parameters at three incubation temperatures were recorded and micromorphology was examined using light microscopy as well as scanning electron microscopy to illustrate and characterize each species. Many specific extrolites were extracted and identified from cultures, including echinulins, epiheveadrides, auroglaucins and anthraquinone bisanthrons, and to be consistent in strains of nearly all species. Other extrolites are species-specific, and thus valuable for identification. Several extrolites show antioxidant effects, which may be nutritionally beneficial in food and beverages. Important mycotoxins in the strict sense, such as sterigmatocystin, aflatoxins, ochratoxins, citrinin were not detected despite previous reports on their production in this section. Adopting a polyphasic approach, 31 species are recognized, including nine new species. ITS is highly conserved in this section and does not distinguish species. All species can be differentiated using CaM or RPB2 sequences. For BenA, Aspergillus brunneus and A. niveoglaucus share identical sequences. Ascospores and conidia morphology, growth rates at different temperatures are most useful characters for phenotypic species identification.","2017-09-01","2018-02-01 21:33:46","2018-02-01 21:33:46","2018-02-01 21:33:46","37-135","","","88","","Studies in Mycology","","Diversity and taxonomy of Food and Indoor Fungi","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\HFR3A52P\Chen et al. - 2017 - Polyphasic taxonomy of Aspergillus section Aspergi.pdf; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\PXVT4ID6\S016606161730026X.html","","","Extrolites; Multi-gene phylogeny","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of this recent work has been ignited by approximately $35 million in research funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s program on the Microbiology of the Built Environment (MoBE). While these recent studies have greatly increased our understanding of microbial community structure and composition on surfaces and in air within the spaces in which we live and work, most have been driven and led primarily by microbiologists with the building science community playing a supporting role. There remains a need to solicit input from expert building scientists, engineers, and other disciplines that make up the building science community on the overall effectiveness of these previous studies for advancing knowledge of microbial communities in the indoor environment, to identify existing gaps in these studies, and to inform a research agenda for future studies of the microbiology of the built environment that stems from deep knowledge of how buildings are constructed, operated, and occupied. Therefore, the workshop described herein, Building science to advance research in the microbiology of the built environment (MoBE), was designed to bring together a group of experts in building science and engineering with a smaller number of microbiologists and microbial ecologists to discuss existing gaps and future opportunities for research on the microbiology of the built environment. Goals of the workshop were to advance the MoBE program’s research goals and ultimately work towards increasing efficiency and impact among grantees by facilitating interdisciplinary discussions.","2014-10-01","2017-12-13 15:03:53","2017-12-13 15:03:53","2017-12-13 15:03:48","","","","","","","Building science to advance research in the microbiology of the built environment (MoBE)","","","","","","","","","","","","Figshare","","DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.1189245.v1","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\XTBIBZ79\1189245.pdf","","","indoor environment; built environment; MoBE; building science; microbiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We adressed the monophyly of both sections within subgenus Aspergillus and applied a multidisciplinary approach for definition of species boundaries in sect. Restricti. The monophyly of sections Aspergillus and Restricti was tested on a set of 102 isolates comprising all currently accepted species and was strongly supported by Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inferrence (BI) analysis based on β-tubulin (benA), calmodulin (CaM) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) loci. More than 300 strains belonging to sect. Restricti from various isolation sources and four continents were characterized by DNA sequencing, and 193 isolates were selected for phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic studies. Species delimitation methods based on multispecies coalescent model were employed on DNA sequences from four loci, i.e., ID region of rDNA (ITS + 28S), CaM, benA and RPB2, and supported recognition of 21 species, including 14 new. All these species were also strongly supported in ML and BI analyses. All recognised species can be reliably identified by all four examined genetic loci. Phenotype analysis was performed to support the delimitation of new species and includes colony characteristics on seven cultivation media incubated at several temperatures, growth on an osmotic gradient (six media with NaCl concentration from 0 to 25 %) and analysis of morphology including scanning electron microscopy. The micromorphology of conidial heads, vesicle dimensions, temperature profiles and growth parameters in osmotic gradient were useful criteria for species identification. The vast majority of species in sect. Restricti produce asperglaucide, asperphenamate or both in contrast to species in sect. Aspergillus. Mycophenolic acid was detected for the first time in at least six members of the section. The ascomata of A. halophilicus do not contain auroglaucin, epiheveadride or flavoglaucin which are common in sect. Aspergillus, but shares the echinulins with sect.

All available Cephalotrichum strains from the culture collection of the Westerdijk Institute were studied, 20 originating from the built environment. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from DNA sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 and intervening 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), and parts of β-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) genes. Additionally, herbarium material of 14 Cephalotrichum species described from soil in China was studied, and the taxonomy of C. album, not considered in recent revisions, was reevaluated. Sixteen phylogenetic species in Cephalotrichum are distinguished, five described as new species: C. domesticum, C. lignatile, C. telluricum, C. tenuissimum and C. transvaalense. Five Cephalotrichum species occur in the built environment: C. domesticum, C. gorgonifer (formerly known as Trichurus spiralis), C. microsporum, C. purpureofuscum, and C. verrucisporum. Based on the number of isolates, C. gorgonifer (nine strains) is the most common indoor species. The study of the Chinese herbarium material resulted in the acceptance of three additional Cephalotrichum species: C. casteneum, C. ellipsoideum, and C. spirale. Four species are considered nomena dubia (C. cylindrosporum, C. macrosporum, C. ovoideum, and C. robustum), five are placed in synonymy with other Cephalotrichum species (C. acutisporum, C. inflatum, C. longicollum, C. oblongum, C. terricola) and one species, C. verrucipes, is probably a synonym of Penicillium clavigerum.

We developed a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms single-tube extractions while processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n = 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192, 123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq protocol. IMPORTANCE Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.","2018-06-26","2018-03-15 13:46:55","2018-03-15 13:46:55","2018-03-15 13:46:55","e00218-17","","3","3","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2018 Minich et al..

Our Hospital Epidemiology Service routinely performs extensive sampling of high-touch surfaces, sinks, and other locations in the hospital. Over a 2-year period, additional sampling was conducted at a broader range of locations, including housekeeping closets, wastewater from hospital internal pipes, and external manholes. We compared these data with previously collected information from 5 years of patient clinical and surveillance isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis of 108 isolates provided comprehensive characterization of blaKPC/blaNDM-positive isolates, enabling an in-depth genetic comparison. Strikingly, despite a very low prevalence of patient infections with blaKPC-positive organisms, all samples from the intensive care unit pipe wastewater and external manholes contained carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs), suggesting a vast, resilient reservoir. We observed a diverse set of species and plasmids, and we noted species and susceptibility profile differences between environmental and patient populations of CPOs. However, there were plasmid backbones common to both populations, highlighting a potential environmental reservoir of mobile elements that may contribute to the spread of resistance genes. Clear associations between patient and environmental isolates were uncommon based on sequence analysis and epidemiology, suggesting reasonable infection control compliance at our institution. Nonetheless, a probable nosocomial transmission of Leclercia sp. from the housekeeping environment to a patient was detected by this extensive surveillance. These data and analyses further our understanding of CPOs in the hospital environment and are broadly relevant to the design of infection control strategies in many infrastructure settings. IMPORTANCE Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are a global concern because of the morbidity and mortality associated with these resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Horizontal plasmid transfer spreads the resistance mechanism to new bacteria, and understanding the plasmid ecology of the hospital environment can assist in the design of control strategies to prevent nosocomial infections. A 5-year genomic and epidemiological survey was undertaken to study the CPOs in the patient-accessible environment, as well as in the plumbing system removed from the patient. This comprehensive survey revealed a vast, unappreciated reservoir of CPOs in wastewater, which was in contrast to the low positivity rate in both the patient population and the patient-accessible environment. While there were few patient-environmental isolate associations, there were plasmid backbones common to both populations. These results are relevant to all hospitals for which CPO colonization may not yet be defined through extensive surveillance.","2018-03-07","2018-03-23 19:11:00","2018-03-23 19:11:00","2018-03-23 19:11:00","e02011-17","","1","9","","mBio","","","","","","","","en","","","","","mbio.asm.org","","PMID: 29437920","","C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\GGTJ9ZK8\Weingarten et al. - 2018 - Genomic Analysis of Hospital Plumbing Reveals Dive.pdf; ; C:\Users\Sparhawk\Zotero\storage\SUZKYI9Y\e02011-17.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437920","","wastewater; antimicrobial resistance; infection control; environment; plumbing; carbapenem resistant; carbapenemase-producing organisms; plasmid-mediated resistance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
